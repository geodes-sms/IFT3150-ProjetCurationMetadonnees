Role-Playing Computer Game to Improve Speech Ability of Down Syndrome Children	"Down syndrome individuals are known to have difficulties in speech, both in pronunciation of words and making
sentences, due to the innate physical impairment of their mouth muscles and their cognitive and intelligence
limitations. An interesting finding by other researchers shows that the vocabulary acquisition rates of these individuals fall
between the range of average to slow, and they hardly use good grammar, although they seem to have good
understanding of casual conversation. However, most research efforts have been dedicated to enhancing their words
recognition ability and computer applications have been developed for reading therapy, whereas the syntax and
expressive language training are rarely focused. In this paper, we propose the use of role playing computer game featuring
state-of-the-art speech recognition technology as an attempt to improve the speech accuracy of down syndrome children in
terms of grammar. The challenges involved the input received in coordinating the speech accuracy. We provide systematic
review on some of the base elements to consider while developing the game for the mildly-impaired down syndrome
individuals, which includes speech recognition technology, cognitive psychology, instructional design models, system
development life cycle, and multimedia in special education."	Down Syndrome; Multimedia Applications; Serious Game; Speech Training	Che Pee, A. N.; Abdullah, M. H. L.; Zakaria, M.

Usability evaluation of the domain specific language for spatial simulation scenarios	This article presents the results of a usability evaluation initiative conducted on the Domain Specific Language for Spatial Simulation Scenarios (short name DSL3S) and its supporting tools. This language applies a Model-Driven Development approach to spatial simulation, providing model development through the composition of graphical elements and the subsequent transformation to source code. Potential users trained in disciplines related to Geographic Information Systems were exposed for a first time to the language with an introductory exercise. After installing the supporting tools and developing a simple spatial simulation model, participants then evaluated the language and its tools by answering a questionnaire. The results of this evaluation point to a good degree of usability, with particularly positive appreciations of the DSL3S supporting tools. Notwithstanding, participants also show some reluctance in adopting such a development framework, hinting at some reminiscent scepticism towards domain specific modelling languages and Model-Driven Development.	spatial simulation; domain specific modelling language; UML profile; model-driven development; model driven architecture (MDA)	de Sousa, Luis Moreira; da Silva, Alberto Rodrigues	Cogent Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1080/23311916.2018.1436889				Google Scholar	2018	Usability Evaluation Of The Domain Specific Language For Spatial Simulation Scenarios	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311916.2018.1436889	Taylor & Francis
Stay Awhile and Listen to 3Buddy, a Co-creative Level Design Support Tool	"There is untapped potential in having a computer work as a colleague with the video game level designer as a source of
creative stimuli, instead of simply working as his slave. This paper presents 3Buddy, a co-creative level design tool exploring this digital peer paradigm, aimed at fostering creativity by allowing human and computer to work together in the context of level design, and describes a case study of the approach to
produce content using the Legend of Grimrock 2 level editor. Suggestions are generated and iteratively evolved by multiple inter-communicating genetic algorithms guiding three different domains: innovation (exploring new directions), guidelines (respecting specific design goals) and convergence (focusing on current co-proposal). The interface allows the designer to orient the tool behaviour in the space defined by these dimensions. This paper details the inner workings of the system and presents an exploratory study showing, on the one hand, how the tool was used differently by professional and amateur level designers, and on the other hand, how the nuances of the co-creative interaction through an intentionoriented interface may be a source of positive influence for the creative level design process."

Pricing and Upgrade Strategies for Software Vendors in the Software-as-a-Service Market 	"This study examines the competition between an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers a standard fixed-price software product and a cloud software vendor (CSV)
who adopts a usage-based linear pricing scheme for its cloud-based software. Using a game theoretic approach, we set up a duopoly model to derive the optimal pricing and
product feature choice decisions for both the ISV and the CSV in a market characterized with heterogeneous consumer preferences for software features, and different risk
structures. Next, we plan to extend the duopoly model into a two-stage game and examine how the equilibrium outcomes change when we allow both vendors to exercise
their software upgrade strategies. The results of our study will provide important implications to vendors and consumers in software markets where the Software-as-aService (SaaS) business model began to prevail and contribute to the growing literature on economics of cloud computing.

Kinematic Simulation of a Line Follower Robot for the Creation of the Programming Videogame Rusty Roads in the Unity Framework	This paper presents the results of a research project for developing Rusty Roads, a videogame that simulates line follower robots in tridimensional, competitive environments. During the software development process, it was necessary to define the key physical factors that could affect the performance of the robot. A real robot was considered to define real parameters for the simulation, and to define discrete equations for simulating the robot in the Unity framework, comparing their accuracy with that of continuous, exact equations specifically developed for this study. This paper presents the process for obtaining and testing those equations, which were the foundations for the successful development of the simulation layer of the videogame and allowed the subsequent creation of its 3D visualization component.	video games; simulation; robotics; line followers; mechanics; robot	Oscar F.

Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification	The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely used to synchronize computer clocks in the Internet. This document describes NTP version 4 (NTPv4), which is backwards compatible with NTP version 3 (NTPv3), described in RFC 1305, as well as previous versions of the protocol. NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family. NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs. It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required. It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]		Mills, D.; J.

The Design, Play, and Experience Framework	This chapter introduces a framework for the design of serious games for learning, called the design, play, and experience framework. The author argues that the great potential of serious games will not be realized without a formal design approach. To that end, the author presents and thoroughly explains the design, play, and experience framework which provides a formal approach to designing the learning, storytelling, game play, user experience, and technology components of a serious game. The author concludes by detailing how the framework provides a common language to discuss serious game design, a methodology to analyze a design, and a process to design a serious game for learning.

"From Knowing It to ""Getting It"": Envisioning Practices in Computer Games Development"	The development of information systems and software applications increasingly needs to deliver culturally rich and affective experiences for user groups. In this paper, we explore how the collaborative practices across different expert groups can enable this experiential dimension of use to be integrated into the development of a software product. In an empirical study of computer games development�an arena in which the novelty and richness of the user experience is central to competitive success�we identify the challenges of conceptualizing and realizing a desired user experience when it cannot be readily specified in an initial design template, nor represented within the expertise of existing groups. Our study develops a theoretical framework to address these challenges. Through this framework, we are able to show how achieving a desired user experience requires developer groups to not only work across the boundaries that arise from specialized expertise, but also across wider fields centred on cultural production and software development, respectively. We find that their ability to do this is supported by distinctive �envisioning practices� that sustain an emerging shared �vision� for each game. The key research contributions that we then make are (a) grounding envisioning practices as a means of theorizing the collaborative practices centred on conceptualizing the user experience; (b) identifying how these practices are interwoven with the �producing practices� of software development, thus enabling collaboration to span expert groups and disparate fields; and (c) theorizing the role of vision as an emerging conceptual boundary object in these practices.	collaborative practice; envizioning; interpretive; computer games development; emergence	Nandhakumar, Joe; Panourgias, Nikiforos S.; Scarbrough, Harry	Information Systems Research	https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2013.0482		933-955		Google Scholar	2013	From Knowing It to �Getting It�: Envisioning Practices in Computer Games Development	https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2013.0482	Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences
"Controlling the uncontrollable: ""Agile"" teams and illusions of autonomy in creative work"	The creative industries have recently been hailed as presenting a liberating model for the future of work and a valuable terrain on which to examine purported new regimes of workplace control. This article, based on the empirical examination of a Canadian video game development studio, traces the modes of control which operate on and through project teams in creative settings. The impact of the adoption of an �emancipatory�, post-bureaucratic project management technology, �Agile�, is critically examined through interviews and non-participative observation of management, technical and artistic labour within one project team. The potential for autonomy in such �Agile� teams is critically assessed within the managerial regime of creative production and the broader power relations implied by the financial, organizational and institutional context.

"The politics of ""platforms"""	Online content providers such as YouTube are carefully positioning themselves to users, clients, advertisers and policymakers, making strategic claims for what they do and do not do, and how their place in the information landscape should be understood. One term in particular, �platform�, reveals the contours of this discursive work. The term has been deployed in both their populist appeals and their marketing pitches, sometimes as technical �platforms�, sometimes as �platforms� from which to speak, sometimes as �platforms� of opportunity. Whatever tensions exist in serving all of these constituencies are carefully elided. The term also fits their efforts to shape information policy, where they seek protection for facilitating user expression, yet also seek limited liability for what those users say. As these providers become the curators of public discourse, we must examine the roles they aim to play, and the terms by which they hope to be judged.

Danish TV Christmas calendars: Folklore, myth and cultural history	This article aims at characterizing the Danish Christmas calendar as a TV institution and a meeting place for the traditions of the almanac, folklore and the history of culture. Against the background of a brief outline of the history of Danish Christmas calendars, the article explores ways in which this traditional genre has succeeded in renewing itself. The so-called Pyrus series, TV 2�s Christmas calendars during the mid-1990s, exhibited folklore, myth and cultural history in a combination of entertainment and information. They were succeeded by calendars such as Jul i Valhal/�Christmas in Valhalla� (2005), Absalons hemmelighed/�The Secret of Absalon� (2006), Mikkel og guldkortet/�Mikkel and the Golden Card� (2008) and Pagten/�The Covenant� (2009). Some of these added cultural criticism to the repertoire of the genre.

Software Licenses in Context: The Challenge of Heterogeneously-Licensed Systems	The prevailing approach to free/open source software and licenses has been that each system is developed, distributed, and used under the terms of a single license. But it is increasingly common for information systems and other software to be composed with components from a variety of sources, and with a diversity of licenses. This may result in possible license conflicts and organizational liability for failure to fulfill license obligations. Research and practice to date have not kept up with this sea-change in software licensing arising from free/open source software development. System consumers and users consequently rely on ad hoc heuristics (or costly legal advice) to determine which license rights and obligations are in effect, often with less than optimal results; consulting services are offered to identify unknowing unauthorized use of licensed software in information systems; and researchers have shown how the choice of a (single) specific license for a product affects project success and system adoption. Legal scholars have examined how pairs of software licenses conflict but only in simple contexts. We present an approach for understanding and modeling software licenses, as well as for analyzing conflicts among groups of licenses in realistic system contexts, and for guiding the acquisition, integration, or development of systems with free/open source components in such an environment. This work is based on an empirical analysis of representative software licenses and of heterogeneously-licensed systems. Our approach provides guidance for achieving a �best-of-breed� component strategy while obtaining desired license rights in exchange for acceptable obligations.

Method for Game Development Driven by User-eXperience: A Study of Rework, Productivity and Complexity of Use	The growing capabilities and revenues of video game development are important factors for software companies. However, game development processes could be considered immature, specifically in the design phase. Ambiguous requirements in game design cause rework. User-eXperience (UX) is usually assessed at the end of the development process, causing difficulties to ensure the interactive experience between the game and users. To reduce these problems, this paper proposes a method for Game Development driven by User-eXperience (GameD-UX) that integrates a repository based on requirements engineering, a model for user experience management, and an adjusted agile process. Two experiments were conducted to study rework and productivity of video game development. Results of the first experiment revealed that GameD-UX causes less rework than conventional approaches, but it induces lower productivity. A tool for supporting the GameD-UX method was developed by considering the lessons learned. The second experiment showed that the software tool increases the productivity and reduces the complexity of use of GameD-UX.

E.GRAPHIC (GAMES RESEARCH APPLIED TO PUBLIC HEALTH WITH INNOVATIVE COLLABORATION) - DESIGNING A SERIOUS GAME PILOT FOR DENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH	Educators are looking towards new methods of engaging and motivating students and encouraging self-directed life-long learning in preparing undergraduates to enter the dental profession. This paper's objective is to report the development of an online collaborative serious game as an e-learning Dental Public Health resource for dental undergraduates. GRAPHIC involved the development of a pilot computer game programme. The game was housed within the Moodle environment. In the game students worked collaboratively to consider the views of key stakeholders in the community and individually to explore population oral health, and the evidence base for community initiatives. The pilot programme was used by students in January 2012 with positive feedback. The learning outcomes of the game were achieved with all students successfully passing the game. The development of a pilot game has demonstrated the effective use of technology enhanced learning in dental public health. The pilot programme demonstrates the potential of using gaming as a teaching tool in dental public health. Learning from the pilot is contributing to further developments including an improved user interface.

Defining an Iterative ISO/IEC 29110 Deployment Package for Game Developers	Software development in a small development team is a challenge, as people have to fulfill several roles, which in larger groups would have dedicated people. To help in this aspect, the ISO/IEC 29110 Lifecycle profiles for Very Small Entities has been developed to help organization and manage the workflow. However, the model presented in the ISO/IEC 29110 is rather abstract, and prominently follows the waterfall approach, even though the documents do amend agile practices as one acceptable approach. In game development this loosely defined approach is problematic, since games industry heavily relies in the agile practices with short cycles of iterations. In this article, the authors present their study of game development organizations, and describe the ISO/IEC 29110 deployment package �Highly Iterative Software Processes� which combines the Entry level model with the industry-specific requirements. In general, the definition of support for the iterative development makes the model feasible for the industry.

Introduction of a process maturity model for market-driven product management and requirements engineering	The area of software product development of software intensive products has received much attention, especially in the area of requirements engineering and product management. Many companies are faced with new challenges when operating in an environment where potential requirements number in thousands or even tens of thousands, and where a product does not have a customer, but any number of customers or markets. The development organization carries not only all the costs of development, but also takes all the risks. In this environment traditional bespoke requirements engineering, together with traditional process assessment and improvement models fall short as they do not address the unique challenges of a market-driven environment. This paper introduces the Market-driven Requirements Engineering Process Model, aimed at enabling process improvement and process assurance for organizations faced with these new challenges. The model is also validated in the industry through three case studies where the model is used for process assessment and improvement suggestion. Initial results show that the model is appropriate for process improvement for organizations operating in a market-driven environment. In addition, the model was designed to be light weight in terms of low cost and thus adapted not only for large organizations but suitable for small and medium enterprises as well.

Doors and Perception: Fiction vs. Simulation in Games	In this paper, the author outlines a theory of the relationship of fictional, virtual and real elements in games. Not much critical attention has been paid to the concept of fiction when applied to games and game worlds, despite many books, articles and papers using the term, often in the title. Here, it is argued that game worlds and their objects are ontologically different from fictional worlds; they are empirically upheld by the game engine, rather than by our mind stimulated by verbal information. Game phenomena such as labyrinths, moreover, are evidence that games contain elements that are just as real as their equivalents outside the game, and far from equal to the fictional counterparts.

Game Engines and Game History	I have a problem: it�s called preaching to the choir.  Nobody here lacks faith in the history of games, and I can only hope that my talk will not reduce your enthusiasm.  That realization eliminates the need for a homily on the value of historical studies.  Instead, I will talk about the possibilities and promises facing the history of games as we plunge forward. What does history offer game studies and what might a history of games give back? These questions guide my thoughts at the end of this conference, which has given so much food for these thoughts.

Beyond the HUD - User Interfaces for Increased Player Immersion in FPS Games	The concept of immersion has been adapted by game developers and game critics to describe a deep and positive game experience. While the definition of this concept varies, the user interface of the game is often said to affect the degree to which players can immerse themselves in a game experience. In cooperation with game developer EA DICE, this master thesis aims to investigate how the notion of immersion affects, and is affected by, the user interface (UI) of first-person shooter games, with the ultimate purpose of delivering user interface guidelines for increased immersion. By conducting a study of contemporary first-person shooter (FPS) games, the current state of user interfaces in FPS games is documented. With the addition of a subjective study of FPS games as well as games of other genres, a design space for UI designers is mapped out in order to provide a structure upon which the guidelines can be built. A literature study of various resources within the fields of ludology, cognitive science and media studies is conducted in order to gain increased understanding of what immersion is and its relation to the game experience. The knowledge acquired is used to formulate various hypotheses of how player immersion is connected to the user interfaces of FPS games. These hypotheses are evaluated by user studies and user tests. Looking at the results of the user tests and the literature study, a final definition of immersion is proposed, upon which the guidelines are based. The first guideline, Know Your Design Space, explains the user interface design space of FPS games and encourages UI designers to look at it as a set of tools. Know Your Game discusses how the competitive focus of the game and the game fiction affects the user interface from an immersion point of view. The guideline Establish Player Agency focuses on how the player can be transferred into the game world by acting within it as an agent rather than simply a player of the game. Finally, Strengthen the Player-Avatar Perceptual Link suggests how the user interface can link the player closer to his in-game character on a perceptual level.

Understanding Reliability and Validity in Qualitative Research	The use of reliability and validity are common in quantitative research and now it is reconsidered in the qualitative research paradigm. Since reliability and validity are rooted in positivist perspective then they should be redefined for their use in a naturalistic approach. Like reliability and validity as used in quantitative research are providing springboard to examine what these two terms mean in the qualitative research paradigm, triangulation as used in quantitative research to test the reliability and validity can also illuminate some ways to test or maximize the validity and reliability of a qualitative study. Therefore, reliability, validity and triangulation, if they are relevant research concepts, particularly from a qualitative point of view, have to be redefined in order to reflect the multiple ways of establishing truth.

Keeping the Game Alive: Evaluating Strategies for the Preservation of Console Video Games	"Interactive fiction and video games are part of our cultural heritage. As original systems cease to work because of hardware and media failures, methods to preserve obsolete video games for future generations have to be developed. The public interest in early video games is high, as exhibitions, regular magazines on the topic and newspaper articles demonstrate. Moreover, games considered to be classic are rereleased for new generations of gaming hardware. However, with the rapid development of new computer systems, the way games look and are played changes constantly. When trying to preserve console video games one faces problems of classified development documentation, legal aspects and extracting the contents from original media like cartridges with special hardware. Furthermore, special controllers and non-digital items are used to extend the gaming experience making it difficult to preserve the look and feel of console video games.

This paper discusses strategies for the digital preservation of console video games. After a short overview of console video game systems, there follows an introduction to digital preservation and related work in common strategies for digital preservation and preserving interactive art. Then different preservation strategies are described with a specific focus on emulation. Finally a case study on console video game preservation is shown which uses the Planets preservation planning approach for evaluating preservation strategies in a documented decision-making process. Experiments are carried out to compare different emulators as well as other approaches, first for a single console video game system, then for different console systems of the same era and finally for systems of all eras. Comparison and discussion of results show that, while emulation works very well in principle for early console video games, various problems exist for the general use as a digital preservation alternative. We show what future work has to be done to tackle these problems."

Onward Through the Fog: Computer Game Collection and the Play of Obsolescence	"In Mardi and a Voyage Thither, novelist Herman Melville writes of the peculiar and startling confluence of memory, objects, valuation, and disfigurement that mark the collector of obsoletia. The story�s antiquary is the picture of perverse depletion, with a body �crooked, and dwarfed, and surmounted by a hump, that sat on his back like a burden� (328), his hut in shambles, and �the precious antiques, and curios, and obsoletes��the objects of his collection��strewn about, all dusty and disordered� (329). This unkempt display cum impromptu museum turns out to present a mere fraction of the curator�s collection, the rest of which is host to countless subtle molds and ravenous worms in a vast catacomb below ground. Traversing this darkened vault, one visitor says, is �like going down to posterity� (332).

As inveterate accumulators ourselves, we can certainly relate to Mardi�s ""extraordinary antiquarian"": pursuing obsolete things has transformed us too (though hopefully not quite so hideously), as well as the work we do and the spaces we do it in. Since 1999, we have been collecting�and subsequently lending out to scholars the world over�computer games, systems, and game-related paraphernalia. By recent estimates, our Learning Games Initiative Archive contains more than 20,000 artifacts, from Venezuelan Pong clones to Mario-themed lollipops. Archival work at this scale and with this diversity is not easy, and it constantly butts up against a host of intractable questions. For example, what does it mean to isolate a thing that no longer has its original value but has taken on a new one? When researchers hold such transmuted artifacts up for inspection, what are they looking for and how might archivists help them to find it? Is the primary work of computer game archivists (and indeed archivists of all types) to protect artifacts from the elements, to enjoin them upon their kin, and to guard over the collection for the sake of some abstract posterity, or is it something more collaborative and communal? Finally, is it possible for research-oriented collectors to engage the process of collection without suffering the deformations of skin and soul (not to mention pocketbook) that often plague the more solipsistic acquirer?

We offer this article as an entr�e to these questions, as a way to begin to attend to some of the theoretical and practical complexities of obsolescence and its negotiation. We do so primarily by focusing on where those complexities intersect with computer games, the new media we collect and study."	obsolete; obsoletia; obsolescence; computer games; play	Thompson, Jason; McAllister, Ken S.; Ruggill, Judd Ethan	M/C Journal	https://doi.org/10.5204/mcj.155				Google Scholar	2009	Onward Through the Fog: Computer Game Collection and the Play of Obsolescence	https://doi.org/10.5204/mcj.155	M/C Journal
Twisty Little Passages Almost All Alike: Applying the FRBR Model to a Classic Computer Game.	Humanities scholars and librarians both confront questions regarding the boundaries of texts and the relationships between various editions, translations and adaptations. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) Final Report from the International Federation of Library Associations has provided the library community with a model for addressing these questions in the bibliographic systems they create. The Preserving Virtual Worlds project has been investigating FRBR's potential as a model for the description of computer games and interactive fiction. While FRBR provides an attractive theoretical model, the complexity of computer games as works makes its application to such software creations problematic in practice.

Developing Digital Games through Software Reuse	"Gaming is an old humans� habit. Games help in logical development and encourage learning of theoretical and practical concepts. Besides they offer entertainment
and challenge. The advent of the personal computer changed this tradition. Every year new challenges arise in a digital format, which lead the young and adults to spend hours
in front of a computer or TV screen in an attempt to overcome hurdles and reach an objective. Quality, sophistication, and constant innovation are attained through complex
computer software that almost has an obligation to improve as each new title is released, due to this game development becomes a challenge. Considering that a game title is
software and thus faces the same restrictions of business applications, this article intends to analyze, under the optics of reuse, if game development resorts to reuse, and where and how this happens.

Work for Play: Careers in Video Game Development	Video games are not only for play; they also provide work. Making video games is a serious--and big--business. Creating these games is complex and requires the collaboration of many developers, who perform a variety of tasks, from production to programming. They work for both small and large game studios to create games that can be played on many different devices, including console systems, computers, and cell phones. This article covers career options in video game development. The first section provides an overview of the development process. The second section describes four groups of video game occupations: designers, programmers, artists, and others. The third section covers the skills and training workers need for these jobs. The fourth section discusses the benefits and challenges of working in the video game industry. And the fifth section provides job-seeking tips for a career in video game development. Suggested resources for additional information are presented.

An MDA-based framework for collaborative business process modelling	"Purpose
This paper aims to present a new approach for developing a framework based on a model driven architecture (MDA) for the modelling of technology?independent collaborative processes.

Design/methodology/approach
The paper suggests a new collaborative process modelling approach based on an MDA and a metamodelling technique. The research method, based on the design science approach, was started by identifying the characteristics of the collaborative processes, which distinguish them from the classical intraorganizational ones. Then, the generic collaborative business process (CBP) modelling framework is developed based on MDA approach and definition of a set of transformation rules through three layers: business, process, and technical. After that, the core component of the framework was the proposition of a generic CBP metamodel at PIM/MDA level. The specific collaboration participant's business processes (expressed as BPMN model) are generated from the generic CBP model represented as an UML2 Profile activity diagram, which is compliant to CBP metamodel. Finally, as proof?of?concept, the architecture of an Eclipse?based open development platform is developed implementing an e?Procurement collaborative process.

Findings
The proposed framework for CBP modelling and the generic CBP metamodel contribute towards a more efficient methodology and have consequences for BPM?related collaboration, facilitating the B2B processes modelling and implementation. In order to demonstrate and evaluate the practical applicability of the framework, the architecture of an Eclipse?based open development platform is developed implementing a collaborative business application on the basis of an e?Procurement use case.

Research limitations/implications
There is a need to focus future research efforts on the improvement of the semi?automatic transformation phase from public to private processes which needs human intervention by adding a suitable interfaces at both sides of the B2B interaction. In addition, the problem of semantic heterogeneities regarding the partner's business process elements (business documents, activity/task names) should be tackled by developing an approach that uses ontology.

Practical implications
Business processes developers find a B2B technology?independent solution for implementing and using interorganizational information systems.

Originality/value
The paper provides a framework that enables the CBP modelling and integrates a generic CBP metamodel. Currently, to the best of the authors' knowledge, such a generic metamodel and his instantiation have not so far been developed."

Comparison of a Traditional and a Video Game Based Balance Training Program	"The aim of the present study is to compare the efficiency of traditional and video game based balance training programs. 22 customers of a health care
centre (age: M = 47.6 yrs; SD = 13.1) volunteered to participate in the experiment. They were randomly assigned to two experimental groups. One group underwent a traditional training program, while the other group trained using the Nintendo Wii Fit TM Balance Board. Between pre and post test procedures, training sessions were performed three times a week for three weeks. In addition to five balance tests (SEBT, ball-handling, two video games, dynamic balance), a questionnaire was applied concerning mood state, self-efficacy, physical activity enjoyment, flow and subjective experience in order to evaluate psychological effects of the interventions. Two-factor analyses of variance showed both general and differential improvements of the two groups for pre and post test measures. Both groups improved their balance performance in 4 of five tests. The traditional group showed a significantly greater improvement in two tests (SEBT: F(1,20) = 8.907, p = .007, ?2 = .308; ball-handling: F(1,20) = 13.578, p = .001, ?2 = .404),
whereas the Wii group showed a significantly greater improvement in one test (Ski Slalom (F(1,20) = 5.101, p = .035, ?2 = .203). Psychological questionnaires revealed neither significant pre-post effects nor differences between the groups for pre and post test measurements. The results confirm that the Nintendo Wii Fit TM may be a suitable medium
of training balance in prevention and rehabilitation of adults. Specific effects of training are more pronounced than transfer between virtual and real performance.

Game design tools: Time to evaluate	The art form of the video game has a very idiosyncratic reliance on the process and practice of its designers. We work with creative and computational problems that form a web of deep complexity. And yet, as I have noticed in my professional practice as a game designer, we do not use tools to support our design process. For more than a decade, designers and researchers have argued for the development and use of both conceptual and concrete tools. To this end, formal and semi-formal game design models have been proposed and, more recently, experimental software-based tools have been developed by the research community. To date, however, none of these tools or models have been adopted into mainstream practice within the game design community. In this paper I argue that it is difficult, if not methodologically flawed, to assess the work in the field of game design support without more qualitative data on how such tools fare in actual game design practice. Evaluation research would be an essential contribution towards answering the question of whether � and if so, how - these experimental formal models and tools can support and improve the game design process.	game design; design tools; ludocore; machinations; game atoms; game diagramming	Katharine, Neil	Proceedings of Nordic DiGRA 2012 Conference	https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/606			"@Conference{digra606, title =""Game design tools: Time to evaluate"", year = ""2012"", author = ""Neil, Katharine"", publisher = ""DiGRA"", address = ""Tampere"", howpublished = ""\url{https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/606}"", booktitle = ""Proceedings of Nordic DiGRA 2012 Conference""}"	Google Scholar	2012	Game Design Tools: Time to Evaluate	https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/606	Digital Games Research Association
Modeling and formal verification of gaming storylines	Video games are becoming more and more interactive with increasingly complex plots. These plots typically involve multiple parallel storylines that may converge and diverge based on player actions. This may lead to situations that are inconsistent or impassable. Current techniques for planning and testing game plots involve naive means such as text documents, spreadsheets, and critical path testing. Recent academic research [1] [2] [3] examines the design planning problems, but neglect testing and veri?cation of the possible plot lines. These complex plots have thus until now been handled inadequately due to a lack of a formal methodology and tools to support them. In this dissertation, we describe how we develop methods to 1) characterize storylines (SChar), 2) de?ne a storyline description language (SDL), and 3) create a storyline veri?cation tool based in formal veri?cation techniques (StoCk) that use our SDL as input. SChar (Storyline Characterization) help game developers characterize the category of story line they are working on (e.g. linear, branching and plot) through a tool that give a set of guided questions. Our SDL allows its users to describe storylines in a consistent format similar to how they reason about storylines, but in such a way that it can be used for formal veri?cation. StoCk accepts storylines, described in SDL, to be formally veri?ed using SPIN for errors. StoCk is also examined in three common use cases found in the gaming industry used as a tool 1) during storyline creation 2) during quality assurance and 3) during storyline implementation. The combination of SChar, SDL, and StoCk provides designers, writers, and developers a novel methodology and tools to verify consistency in large and complex game plots.

Game Design by Numbers: Instrumental Play and the Quantitative Shift in the Digital Game Industry	"This dissertation chronicles ideological, technological and economic changes in the digital game industry, focusing on how games are transforming as play becomes
instrumentalized. It pays particular attention to the struggles of developers as they search for creative freedom and autonomy in a risk-averse industry. It makes original
contributions to the literature on games by situating and explaining industiy-wide shifts in terms of the socio-economics of game development and the rationalities that drive
individual developers. It contributes to social theory more generally by explaining how transformations in play, games, and creativity are linked to much wider adaptations in the
operation of capitalism and how it is justified to both workers and consumers. I use ground-level accounts from those within the game industry to describe how new media technologies interact with socio-economic forces, detailing the adaptability of capitalist modes of production in the face of critique. I show how definitions of 'games'
and 'play' are changing as they come into contact with technology, allowing games to be reformulated in powerful new ways, so games are not only tools of entertainment but also tools of governance. I argue that the collective valuation of objective quantitative data and the belief in the fallibility of individual creative autonomy has turned game design into ""design by numbers"". The complementary themes of this thesis are bound together by references to the ""New Spirit of Capitalism"" (Boltanski and Chiapello 2007, 2005), which explains how capitalism is continually reorganizing itself, adapting the language and spirit of 1960s counterculture and emphasizing freedom in order to drive though new, more efficient, work practices and more subde forms of exploitation. This ""New Spirit"" accounts for the current upheavals in the game industry. Changes to the Spirit of Capitalism have initiated tectonic shifts, reforming the geography of the game industry and creating fissures in the landscape that allow new game sectors to emerge, while others struggle to avoid being buried. In turn, innovations from the game industry, particularly the emphasis on datadriven design, shore up the weaknesses in the New Spirit of Capitalism, allowing it to operate more successfully."	digital games; game development; game industry; Instrumentalization of Play; New Spirit of Capitalism; governance; surveillance	Whitson, Jennifer R.

Usability of Web sites, methods and evaluation techniques	In the present society, the relevance of the Web is unquestionable and there is a great variety of Web sites that offer services to users. In this context, usability plays a fundamental role in the process of developing successful Web sites. In this article we review different definitions about the discipline of usability, its incorporation in the engineering process (usability engineering) and its relation to software engineer, as well as its attributes and evaluation methods. The considerations about the evaluation system of the Web usability are also presented, advising the user and basing it in the establishment of critical tasks (SIRIUS, reviewed by the authors).

Jumping the Gap: Indie Labour and the Imagined Indie Community	Due to the recent proliferation of free-to-use, professional-quality development tools, crowdsourced fundraising, and the ascendency of digital distribution platforms, �indie� digital game developers are emerging on an unprecedented scale. Based on ethnographic research conducted at indie accelerator Execution Labs from January to June of 2015, this thesis explores how indie developers frame risk, creativity, success, and failure in relation to the communities they are a part of. The first three chapters highlight useful concepts from Gina Neff�s �Venture Labour� (2012), describe Execution Labs from the researcher�s perspective, and detail the researcher�s approach to collaborative embedded ethnography, respectively. The fourth chapter is dedicated to two related purposes: the first part will posit that communities of indie developers and indie fans share a common creative discourse, and thus constitute what Benedict Anderson has termed an �Imagined Community� (2006). The latter portion of the chapter will explore how Newgrounds.com facilitated discourses about digital games and Macromedia Flash, and how the resultant imagined communities have influenced contemporary indie identity and development practice. The final chapter opens by proposing a definition of �indie labour�: a creative, communitarian strategy with which indie developers manage the risks they face. It will then consider the stories of those who performed indie labour as part of Execution Labs. This thesis will conclude by ruminating on potential future avenues of study and ongoing issues that hinder indie development�s potential as an open and accessible praxis.

Bomberman as an Artificial Intelligence Platform	"Computer games have a long tradition in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. They serve the purpose of establishing challenging goals with long term positive repercussions, with researchers trying to develop AIs capable of beating the world human experts. They also provide a good amount of exposition in mainstream media, whilst also giving an engaging environment for teaching computer science concepts in general and AI methods in particular. This thesis aims precisely to contribute to the educational gaming landscape, by providing a novel Bomberman themed platform and several associated intelligent agents. Our first major contribution is precisely the platform itself, Bomberman
as an Artificial Intelligence Platform (BAIP). We provide a fully functional opensource, graphical, language agnostic platform, aimed towards facilitating the study and development of AI methods. We showcase the potential of BAIP and the richness of the selected game environment by developing a plethora of AI agents using different methodologies. At an initial level we introduce a set of basic heuristic methods capable of providing agents with the most essential behavior primitives, equipping them for basic survival in the game environment. At a more advanced level we introduce search-based methods capable of some form of planning. From a machine learning perspective we show how BAIP can be integrated and used with Reinforcement Learning (RL). We use a simple RL problem within the platform and implement both Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms in order to tackle it. This thesis also provides detailed and thorough experimental results about all the developed agents and methods, using the developed platform capabilities. To sum up, this work introduces a new AI platform, gives a strong baseline agent and demonstrates the feasibility of using it for machine learning tasks."

Requirements Engineering in Scrum Framework	Requirement Engineering (RE) plays an important role in the success of software development life cycle. As RE is the starting point of the life cycle, any changes in requirements will be costly and time consuming. Failure in determining accurate requirements leads to errors in specifications and therefore to a mal system architecture. In addition, most of software development environments are characterized by user requests to change some requirements.Scrum as one of agile development methods that gained a great attention because of its ability to deal with the changing environments.

Software in 30 days: how agile managers beat the odds, delight their customers, and leave competitors in the dust	We, Jeff and Ken, have been in the software industry, collectively, for 70 years. We have been software developers, managers in IT organizations and software product companies, and owners of both product companies and service organizations. More than 20 years ago, we created a process that lets organizations deliver software better. Since then, we have helped hundreds of organizations do the same. Our work has spread further than we have ever imagined possible, being put to use by millions of people. We are humbled by the extent of its adoption, and we are awed by the feats people have accomplished using it. This is not the first book we have written on the topic of building software. It is, however, the first book we have written for people who do not themselves build software. This book is instead for leaders within organizations that depend on software for their survival and competitiveness. It is for leaders within organizations that can benefit from developing software rapidly, inerementally. and with the best return on investment possible. It is for leaders who face business and technological complexity that has made the delivery of software difficult. We have written this book so that these leaders can help their organizations achieve these goals, enhance their internal capabilities, improve their product offerings, and more. This book is for chief executive officers (CEOs), executives, and senior managers who need their organizations to deliver better software in less time, with lower cost, greater predictability, and lower risk. For this audience, we have a message: You may have had negative experiences with software devel- opment in the past, but the industry has turned a corner. The software profes- sion has radically improved its methods and its results. The uncertainty, risk, and waste to which you are accustomed are no longer par for the course. We have worked with many software organizations that have already turned the corner; we want to help you do so, too. In this book, we show you how to create business value using a process that delivers complete pieces of software functionality at least every 30 days. This book will show you how you can prioritize the functionality you want and have it delivered � la carte. It will show you how to gain transparency not only into business value, by tracking functionality delivered against functionality desired, but also into the health of the software development process and your organization as a whole. The tools in this book will help you work with your software organization to get up to speed with modern practices and begin to deliver the results you've been expecting all along. This is software in 30 days.

Gaming Culture at the Boundaries of Play	As the field of game studies and research has matured, multiple valid, yet somewhat differently oriented approaches to games, play and players have emerged. One of them is the cultural study of games and play related phenomena. Both the British and American traditions of cultural studies have been particularly interested in advancing our understanding of popular culture by tracing its position and significance from perspectives opened up by politics, economics, sociology, as well as by literary or textual studies, to mention just a few elements from this highly interdisciplinary field. Where the hallmark of British cultural studies used to be reliance on some version of Marxism or left-wing critique of capitalist society and its cultural industries, and the American approach to cultural studies was more likely to develop liberalist analyses of empowered audiences, or fandom activities, this divide does not stand out so clearly these days. While approaching Cheating by Mia Consalvo, it is nevertheless useful to be keep in mind such intellectual traditions and debates.

Engineering emergence: applied theory for game design	Dit proefschrift presenteert twee theoretische kaders voor het ontwerpen van games en beschrijft hoe game designers deze kunnen inzetten om het game ontwerpproces te stroomlijnen. Er bestaan op dit moment meerdere ontwerptheorie�en voor games, maar geen enkele kan rekenen op een breed draagvlak binnen de game industrie. Vooral academische ontwerptheorie�en hebben regelmatig een slechte reputatie. Het eerste kader dat game designers inzicht biedt in spelregels en hun werking heet Machinations en maakt gebruik van dynamische, interactieve diagrammen. Het tweede theoretische kader van dit proefschrift, Mission/Space, richt zich op level-ontwerp en spelmechanismen die de voortgang van een speler bepalen. In tegenstelling tot bestaande modellen voor level-ontwerp, bouwt Mission/Space voort op het idee dat er in een level twee verschillende structuren bestaan. Mission-diagrammen worden gebruikt om de structuur van taken en uitdagingen voor de speler te formaliseren, terwijl space-diagrammen de ruimtelijke constructie formaliseren. Beide constructies zijn aan elkaar gerelateerd, maar zijn niet hetzelfde. De verschillende wijzen waarop missies geprojecteerd kunnen worden op een bepaalde ruimte speelt uiteindelijk een belangrijke rol in de totstandkoming van de spelervaring.

The Free Lunch Is Over: A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software	Your free lunch will soon be over. What can you do about it? What are you doing about it? The major processor manufacturers and architectures, from Intel and AMD to Sparc and PowerPC, have run out of room with most of their traditional approaches to boosting CPU performance. Instead of driving clock speeds and straight-line instruction throughput ever higher, they are instead turning en masse to hyperthreading and multicore architectures. Both of these features are already available on chips today; in particular, multicore is available on current PowerPC and Sparc IV processors, and is coming in 2005 from Intel and AMD. Indeed, the big theme of the 2004 In-Stat/MDR Fall Processor Forum was multicore devices, as many companies showed new or updated multicore processors. Looking back, it�s not much of a stretch to call 2004 the year of multicore. And that puts us at a fundamental turning point in software development, at least for the next few years and for applications targeting general-purpose desktop computers and low-end servers (which happens to account for the vast bulk of the dollar value of software sold today). In this article, I�ll describe the changing face of hardware, why it suddenly does matter to software, and how specifically the concurrency revolution matters to you and is going to change the way you will likely be writing software in the future. Arguably, the free lunch has already been over for a year or two, only we�re just now noticing.

Methods for Game User Research Studying Player Behavior to Enhance Game Design	The emerging field of game user research (GUR) investigates interaction between players and games and the surrounding context of play. Game user researchers have explored methods from, for example, human-computer interaction, psychology, interaction design, media studies, and the social sciences. They've extended and modified these methods for different types of digital games, such as social games, casual games, and serious games. This article describes several current GUR methods. A case study illustrates two specific methods: think-aloud and heuristics.	game user research; computer games; human-computer interaction; software development; computer graphics; think-aloud; Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation; RITE; heuristics; playtesting; game usability; game playability; A/B testing	Desurvire, Heather; El-Nasr, Magy Self	IEEE COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND APPLICATIONS	https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2013.61		82-87		Web of Science	2013	Methods For Game User Research Studying Player Behavior To Enhance Game Design	https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2013.61	IEEE COMPUTER SOC

Write-once,transpile-everywhere:Re-usingmotioncontrollersofvirtualhumansacrossmultiplegameengines|Signedin	Transpilation allows to write code once and re-use it across multiple runtime environments. In this paper, we propose a software development practice to implement once the motion controllers of virtual humans and re-use the implementation in multiple game engines. In a case study, three common human behaviors � blinking, text-to-speech, and eye-gaze � were developed in the Haxe programming language and deployed in the free, open-source Blender Game Engine and the commercial Unity engine. Performance tests show that transpiled code executes within 67% faster to 127% slower with respect to an implementation manually written in the game engine target languages.

Scott and the logs: design and data capture in a preparatory online package for children undergoing GA for dental procedures	This National Institute of Health Research project aims to test if children scheduled for anaesthesia benefit from an interactive online package. The project deals with the design and data capture (logs) of a prototype (alpha) online interactive cartoon created to answer the research question: �Will internet delivered information help children cope better with anaesthesia?� Following modification of the alpha package the resultant beta package will be compared to two control groups: standard care procedures and a non-medical computer game. An international academic audience provided positive feedback on the package design and data capture. The animation package sets an example of good practice in design for other similar healthcare scenarios.

Encore: Atari's Second System A design story	In 1975, Fredrick Brooks wrote an amazing book, The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering [1]. The book applies to managing engineering, not just software. Brooks got his experience the hard way: he managed the development of IBM?s OS/360. At that time in history, in the mid-1960s, it was the largest software project ever attempted. In the 1990s, I worked on several versions of Microsoft Windows, which were even larger. Brooks? writing was directly applicable.

Rubber Ball to Cloud Rehabilitation(c) Musing on the Future of Therapy	Summary form only. We can trace the origins of virtual rehabilitation to the late 80s when sensing gloves were used to determine the degree of hand tremor in patients with Parkinson, and virtual environments were investigated as a medium to train wheelchair navigation. At the first Medicine Meets Virtual Reality conference in San Diego in 1992, we proposed a unified system where sensing gloves were used to diagnose and train patients post hand surgery. Other researchers pioneered the use of virtual environments in phobias, attention deficit, post-traumatic stress and other conditions. In 1996 researchers interested primarily in VR phobia treatment started the CyberTherapy conference series, and VR-based physical therapy, occupational therapy, therapy for learning deficits, and amnesia were reported at the first International Conference on Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated Technologies. By 1997 the National Science Foundation funded a study of rehabilitation at a distance between Rutgers and Stanford universities, located on either side of the United States. These beginnings used color-coded virtual rubber balls and haptic gloves to program the mechanical work done by the patient's affected hand. An artificial separation existed in the clinical practice between physical or occupational rehabilitation and cognitive therapy, due in part to separate education tracks. Nonetheless virtual reality researchers realized that the same hardware could be used in either physical or cognitive rehabilitation, and all that needed changing was the simulation software used. We thus coined the term ldquovirtual rehabilitationrdquo to encompass the continuum of therapy. In 2002 the associated conference started in Switzerland as the International Workshop on Virtual Rehabilitation. This later became the Virtual Rehabilitation International Conference series which you are attending today. While ldquovirtual rehabilitationrdquo was initially met with some skepticism by therapists who were concerned patients will misunderstand it, nowadays the term is better understood. To help further recognition for this emerging field, a new society was formed in 2008, the International Society for Virtual Rehabilitation (www.isvr.org), which is a co-sponsor of this conference. The merging of physical/occupational therapy and cognitive therapy is not due solely to the modularity offered by the hardware and software used in virtual environments. Another cause is the fact that patients affected by certain neurologic and motor deficits often have psychological and other cognitive co-morbidities. A well known example is depression associated with some types of stroke or with societal isolation that often follows the inability to have regular employment. The same tele-rehabilitation systems that are projected for large scale use to train patients in their home, may also be used to reduce the sense of isolation. Video games that are now being investigated as a way to reinvigorate therapeutic interventions could also be used in future game ldquotournamentsrdquo among teams of people with disabilities, or among people with disabilities and their families and friends. Virtual environments could then be used to customize the games and allow a patient to succeed, greatly boosting morale. An extreme example is the use of virtual hand avatars controlled by people with amputated arms, an application which we pioneered back in 2003. Popular awareness of and demand for virtual rehabilitation is expected to grow, which in turn will trigger changes in the way therapists are educated and accredited. A new field of study will emerge, as will the way therapists and psychologists will be recertified. Certainly the way licensing, insurance, even liability clauses follow local geography is archaic, and a more global certification program is expected to emerge. The one-to-one paradigm of therapy will also change, with one therapist performing ldquomultiplexedrdquo tele-rehabilitation. This is expected to reduce treatment costs while also increasing access to therapeutic care worldwide. Certain technologies will need to advance to act as force multipliers and to help therapists handle the expected workload increase. One supporting technology will be home-based robots which will not only clean, cook and guard, but extend their use to provision of therapy, especially physical therapy. Advances in technology will provide the ability to take therapy anywhere, anytime, addressing current limitation due to geographical location, lack of transportation, limited therapist availability or endurance. This will be facilitated by the proliferation of portable computing/communication terminals coupled to powerful mega-servers, in what is called today ldquocloud computing.rdquo We predict that cloud computing will be extended to ldquocloud rehabilitationrdquo by transforming these portable devices into rehabilitation systems. In cloud rehabilitation the library of disability-specific software simulations or games will reside on a third-party ldquocloudrdquo of web servers. This is where clinicians will log on to set up rehabilitation regimens, follow up patient progress, insure compliance and monitor safety. By concentrating software maintenance and licensing to a unified web structure, the current information technology problems that plague healthcare institutions will be alleviated, the portability of medical data improved and the defense against unauthorized access to medical data boosted. The way to cloud rehabilitation seems straightforward - new types of input devices to measure the patient's input, games that allow clinically meaningful variables to be stored and therapeutic regimens set and monitored, distributed databases storing medical data securely, reliable and encoded communication, and of course, more computer savvy patient and therapist populations.

Whack-a-Meltdown: Microarchitectural Security Games	In early 2018, the disclosure of Spectre and Meltdown exposed the security risks inherent in speculative and out-of-order execution, which were hitherto considered harmless and valuable performance optimizations. In a nutshell, these attacks demonstrated that transient execution, where the computer executes code speculatively before reverting execution, leaves side effects on the microarchitecture, allowing adversaries to retrieve data across software- and hardware-enforced security boundaries.

Do Improve Typing Skill But No Significant Difference between Drill-Based and Game-Based Typing Software	"Improving typing skill can help students use computers to deal with different kinds of tasks more efficiently. In the past, typing software was commonly used to train students� typing skill, and they usually didn�t have much attractive multimedia effect. In recent years, games have become more and more popular, and one of the reasons is that games have lots of attractive elements, like lots of multimedia effect and interesting scripts. About the educational effect of typing games, game is more interesting than traditional instruction, and that�s the reason why people use typing games to train their typing skill. This study tried to realize the effect on typing skill of drill-based and game-based typing software, and proposed possible design direction for typing software.

There were 160 second year junior high school students participating in this study. The students studied in a junior high school in middle Taiwan, and they came from five different classes. After excluding six invalid samples, 82 students were males (53.2%) and 72 students were females (46.8%). Pretest-posttest control group design was used in this study. The independent variable was different types of typing software. There were 92 students in the control group, and they used drill-based typing software to learn typing. There were 62 students in the experimental group, and they used game-based typing software to learn typing. The dependent variable was typing speed. The difference of typing speed between pre-test and post-test and the effect on typing speed of different software would be compared.

The result showed that both kinds of typing software could improve students� typing speed, but the effect on typing speed between the two kinds of software didn�t reach significant difference. The result indicated that both entertainment and learning design direction were beneficial for learning typing skill, but different kinds of design also showed different disadvantages and limitations. Therefore, it is better to consider the two aspects at the same time when design edutainment software, and try to keep the balance between the two elements to produce the optimal learning effect. The future studies may confirm if the learning effect from both learning element and entertainment element is better than the learning effect only from learning element or entertainment element."

Implementing Virtual Agents: a HABA-Based Approach	In recent years developments in gaming technology have focused on Massively Multi-User Persistent Worlds. This virtual communities host thousands of users interacting with each other through the Internet in real time. Such communities require new distributed programming paradigms for implementing the virtual life management. In this work we present a practical methodology to add Virtual Agents to Massively Multi-User Persistent Worlds. To demonstrate the use of our methodology we present a realworld application. It adds a set of virtual agents to a 3D chat. The agents survey the users to obtain data to evaluate the processes and components of the virtual world.

Industry life-cycle theory in the cultural domain: Dynamics of the games industry	"Industry life-cycle theory is interested in changes in key industry variables, including entry and exit rates, firm numbers, price, performance and concentration, and in innovative activity as the industry ages. To date, industry life-cycle studies have concentrated on traditional manufacturing industries that produce utilitarian goods. The present study investigates the dynamics of the games industry which is a prime example of a non-manufacturing and non-utilitarian industry. As prior research on the games industry is scarce, the cultural industries literature is reviewed to shed light on the conformities and deviations that can be expected to be found between the propositions of the industry life-cycle theory and the empirical analysis on the games industry. The specificities of cultural industries are discussed in terms of economic characteristics, management challenges and industry dynamics.
The empirical study comprises two analytical steps. The first one investigates the evolution of the games industry with standard industry life-cycle tools. In the second one a qualitative systems dynamics model on the micromechanisms of the game development sector is built to explain the observations made in the first step.
The key finding of the study is that the dynamics of the games industry differ from the propositions of the industry life-cycle theory in two respects. Firstly, innovative activity has not levelled off in either hardware or software. Secondly, game development has remained an unconcentrated industry. The innovative activity is explained by the constant need for novelty common to all cultural industries and it manifests in the key role that the production of original ideas has in game development firms. The low level of concentration is explained by lesser economies of scale caused by increasing management challenges and the increasing risk of bankruptcy with increase in firm size.
The study contributes (1) by applying the industry life-cycle theory to the cultural domain, (2) by combining the phenomena listed in the cultural industries literature and analysing their effect on industry dynamics, (3) by examining the evolution of the games industry in both hardware and software sectors and (4) by highlighting the micromechanisms that produce industry dynamics. The study also has implications for policy-making and management practice. These relate to different forms of public funding, education, outsourcing and the key role of original IP."

A formal support for incremental behavior specification in agile development	Incremental development is now state of the practice. Indeed, it is promoted from the rational unified process to agile development methods. Few methods however guide software developers and architects in doing so. For instance, no tool is proposed to verify the non-regression of functionalities, modeled as behavior specifications, between increments. This work helps to incrementally specify software functionalities using UML state machines. It provides an on-the-fly evaluation of a specified behavior as compared to that of previous increments. The proposed contribution is based on two formally specified relations that are proved to preserve refinement when composed. Architects and developers are free to choose their preferred behavior specification strategy by iteratively applying them, so as to develop the required functionalities, having at each step the benefit of a formal non-regression checking to guide the global specification process.

Design Patterns and General Video Game Level Generation	Design patterns have become a vital solution for a number of problems in software engineering. In this paper, we have performed rhythmic analysis of General Video Game Level Generation (GVG-LG) framework and have discerned 23 common design patterns. In addition, we have segregated the identified patterns into four unique classes. The categorization is based on the usage of identified patterns in game levels. Our future aim is to employ these patterns as an input for a search based level generator.

Model-Based Engineering for Embedded Systems in Practice	Model-Based Engineering (MBE) aims at increasing the e?ectiveness of engineering by using models as key artifacts in the development process. While empirical studies on the use and the e?ects of MBE in industry generally exist, there is only little work targeting the embedded systems domain. We contribute to the body of knowledge with a study on the use and the assessment of MBE in that particular domain. Therefore, we collected quantitative data from 112 subjects, mostly professionals working with MBE, with the goal to assess the current State of Practice and the challenges the embedded systems domain is facing. Of the 112 subjects, the majority are experienced with MBE, working at large companies in the automotive, avionics, or healthcare domains. Additionally, mainly OEMs and First-tier suppliers are represented in the study. Our main findings are that MBE is used by a majority of all participants in the embedded systems domain, mainly for simulation, code generation, and documentation. Reported positive e?ects of MBE are higher quality and improved reusability. Main shortcomings are interoperability difficulties between MBE tools, high training e?ort for developers and usability issues. The data also shows that there are no large di?erences between subgroups with respect to domains, position in the value chain, company size and product size.

Play-Graph: A Methodology and Visualization Approach for the Analysis of Gameplay Data	Instrumentation to automatically log information � so called gameplay metrics � about the player-game interaction has become an important tool for analyzing player behavior in games. However, due to the usually large amount of gathered data, analysis of the collected data can be challenging. Visualizations have become a promising addition to statistical techniques to explore and better understand the data. In this paper we build upon our previous work on gameplay analysis and introduce the concept of a play-graph as a way to formally describe and visualize gameplay data. Difference graphs are used to depict the changes between two different datasets � a relevant but currently neglected task in gameplay analytics. Furthermore, we address issues in regard to the visual representation of our former prototype. Data obtained from a puzzle game, a team-based shooter, and a MMORPG are used to illustrate the concepts.

Human-Computer Interaction - INTERACT 2009	INTERACT 2009 was the 12th of a series of INTERACT international c- ferences supported by the IFIP Technical Committee 13 on Human�Computer Interaction. This year,INTERACT washeld in Uppsala (Sweden), organizedby the Swedish Interdisciplinary Interest Group for Human�Computer Interaction (STIMDI) in cooperation with the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University. Like its predecessors, INTERACT 2009 highlighted, both to the academic and to the industrial world, the importance of the human�computer interaction (HCI) area and its most recent breakthroughs on current applications. Both - perienced HCI researchers and professionals, as well as newcomers to the HCI ?eld, interested in designing or evaluating interactive software, developing new interaction technologies, or investigating overarching theories of HCI, found in INTERACT 2009 a great forum for communication with people of similar int- ests, to encourage collaboration and to learn. INTERACT 2009 had Research and Practice as its special theme. The r- son we selected this theme is that the research within the ?eld has drifted away from the practicalapplicability of its results and that the HCI practice has come to disregard the knowledge and development within the academic community.

A New Villain: Investigating Steganography in Source Engine Based Video Games	In an ever expanding field such as computer and digital forensics, new threats to data privacy and legality are presented daily. As such, new methods for hiding and securing data need to be created. Using steganography to hide data within video game files presents a solution to this problem. In response to this new method of data obfuscation, investigators need methods to recover specific data as it may be used to perform illegal activities. This paper demonstrates the widespread impact of this activity and shows how this problem is present in the real world. Our research also details methods to perform both of these tasks: hiding and recovery data from video game files that utilize the Source gaming engine.

GameSpace: Methods and Evaluation for Casual Mobile Multiplayer Games	"GameSpace was a new kind of a research project: it involved close collaboration between academic researchers and the game industry, and it looked at the methodological issues involved in game creation rather than focusing on a single game product or technology. The project was funded by the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes) and five industry partners. The GameSpace industry partners were Nokia Research Center, Veikkaus, TeliaSonera Finland, Sulake Corporation and Digital Chocolate. The project ran for over two years, from August 1st 2006 to September 30th 2008.
GameSpace looked at the design and evaluation of games that are characterised by three main features: they are casual multiplayer games in a mobile use context. The goals for the project were threefold:

� To analyse the playability criteria of a successful mobile multiplayer game - especially in terms of casual gameplay.
� To develop and evaluate game design methodologies suited for the aforementioned games.
� To develop and test gameplay evaluation methods suited for mobile game development and research.

On a broader level, the project could be divided into two major themes. The first theme was design space, involving the study of casuality, mobility and mobile use context. The first phase of the project mostly consisted of conceptual analysis where a deeper and clearer understanding of the design space was sought. This phase mostly focused on the phenomenon of casual games. The aim was to understand the specific features that make a game casual. Casuality in games has not been studied rigorously before, which made it an interesting and important research topic. The second theme was methodological study on exploring and researching new approaches and methods for designing and evaluating casual mobile multiplayer games. The second theme was called design research.
The research project was executed by a series of workshops in which the industry partners and the research team worked in collaboration. The workshop themes followed the design space and the design research topics. The first three workshops focused on ideation methods for casual mobile multiplayer games. In these workshops, the GameSpace research team iteratively designed different ideation methods which would be used in the process of game ideation. Later the ideation methods formed a complete package, which was tested by the industry partners during a three-month actual use period. The next two workshops focused on low and medium fidelity prototyping. The workshops focused on practical prototyping work with various casual mobile multiplayer concepts. The sixth workshop focused on using expert evaluation methods in mobile game evaluation. In addition to the evaluation workshop, the GameSpace research team was involved in various case evaluations for different games which we!
re evaluated with both expert evaluation and user evaluation methods. The case evaluation work was done in close co-operation with the IPerG -project (Integrated Project on Pervasive Gaming). The last workshop expanded the scope of GameSpace by focusing on the user experiences with different games and game related services. This last workshop acted as a stepping stone for upcoming research projects and it will be reported on elsewhere.
The project produced interesting new knowledge on all of the major research areas of the project. Especially the findings on the phenomenon of casual games and the exploratory work on methodological idea generation are leading edge in game research. The prototyping and the evaluation phases also produced new knowledge and the research team produced several conference articles from all these research areas. In addition to the conference articles, the project produced two master's theses. The project received good feedback from the industry partners and led to two continuation projects, SoPlay and GaIn .
This final report contains the knowledge acquired from the GameSpace project. Like the project itself, this final report is divided into two main sections: design space and design research. The design space covers the special characteristics of casuality, mobility and the multiplayer aspects. The design research focuses on game ideation, game prototyping and game evaluation methods. In addition to this final report, the research team will produce a Flash-based application which reflects the content of this report on a broader level."

Biometric storyboards: a games user research approach for improving qualitative evaluations of player experience	Developing video games is an iterative and demanding process. It is difficult to achieve the goal of most video games � to be enjoyable, engaging and to create revenue for game developers � because of many hard-to-evaluate factors, such as the different ways players can interact with the game. Understanding how players behave during gameplay is of vital importance to developers and can be uncovered in user tests as part of game development. This can help developers to identify and resolve any potential problem areas before release, leading to a better player experience and possibly higher game review scores and sales. However, traditional user testing methods were developed for function and efficiency oriented applications. Hence, many traditional user testing methods cannot be applied in the same way for video game evaluation. This thesis presents an investigation into the contributions of physiological measurements in user testing within games user research (GUR). GUR specifically studies the interaction between a game and users (players) with the aim to provide feedback for developers to help them to optimise the game design of their title. An evaluation technique called Biometric Storyboards is developed, which visualises the relationships between game events, player feedback and changes in a player�s physiological state. Biometric Storyboards contributes to the field of human-computer interaction and GUR in three important areas: (1) visualising mixedmeasures of player experience, (2) deconstructing game design by analysing game events and pace, (3) incremental improvement of classic user research techniques (such as interviews and physiological measurements). These contributions are described in practical case studies, interviews with game developers and laboratory experiments. The results show this evaluation approach can enable games user researchers to increase the plausibility and persuasiveness of their reports and facilitate developers to better deliver their design goals. Biometric Storyboards is not aimed at replacing existing methods, but to extend them with mixed methods visualisations, to provide powerful tools for games user researchers and developers to better understand and communicate player needs, interactions and experiences. The contributions of this thesis are directly applicable for user researchers and game developers, as well as for researchers in user experience evaluation in entertainment systems.

10 Coordination in Organizations: An Integrative Perspective	Coordination, the process of interaction that integrates a collective set of interdependent tasks, is a central purpose of organizations. In this review we begin by discussing the origins of interest in coordination, tracing some of the classic perspectives. We present a review of recent literature on coordination in organizations arranged according to the mechanisms that help achieve it. We then go beyond this review to provide a framework to understand what different coordination mechanisms and activities accomplish. We propose that coordination mechanisms (such as routines, meetings, plans, and schedules) impact the work of organizations by creating three integrative conditions for coordinated activity: accountability, predictability, and common understanding. We end by examining the implications of such a perspective for future research on coordination in organizations.		Okhuysen, Gerardo A.; Bechky, Beth A.

Hidden Markov Model based Speech Synthesis: A Review	A Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system is the artificial production of human system. This paper reviews recent research advances in field of speech synthesis with related to statistical parametric approach to speech synthesis based on HMM. In this approach, Hidden Markov Model based Text to speech synthesis (HTS) is reviewed in brief. The HTS is based on the generation of an optimal parameter sequence from subword HMMs. The quality of HTS framework relies on the accurate description of the phoneset. The most attractive part of HTS system is the prosodic characteristics of the voice can be modified by simply varying the HMM parameters, thus reducing the large storage requirement.

Model-Driven Game Development Addressing Architectural Diversity and Game Engine-Integration	Model-Driven Game Development (MDGD) is an emerging research field, which uses models to specify some or all of the game elements that traditionally had been manually coded. The PhD thesis presents research in the MDGD domain, which is intended to push MDGD further towards industrialization by reducing two gaps: 1) The integration of MDGD tools and game engines, and 2) The support for a diversity of game architectures. These gaps have been identified through a literature review of existing MDGD approaches, which is also documented in the thesis. To reduce the first gap, the model-driven approach Engine Cooperative Game Modeling (ECGM) has been proposed, which uses a run-time game engine as the base for building a domain framework, and engine tools together with MDGD tools for creating game code and data. The code generator generates both game code and level data from game models, making the game models operable in the engine tools. ECGM has been evaluated through being instantiated with a Domain Specific Language (DSL), Reactive AI Language (RAIL) tools, and the commercial game engine Torque 2D. The DSL and engine were used to develop a prototype game, whose evaluation showed that ECGM can significantly improve the productivity and enable an efficient workflow. To reduce the second gap, the game architecture framework Game Worlds Graph (GWG) has been proposed. GWG has then been used as the conceptual base for a MDGD approach supporting a diversity of game architectures. The GWG-based MDGD approach employs the Global World, Local World, and Connector Type concepts in modeling languages, adding the architectural information to the modeled game elements, with which code for different architectures can be generated. To evaluate the approach, a DSL and its tool-chain were created following the approach, and a prototype game supporting three game architectures were developed. The results of the prototyping showed that the MDGD approach and the DSL resulted in significant improvement in productivity and workflow efficiency. Apart from providing a major research contribution bridging the two gaps described above, the GWG framework itself is a valuable research contribution. The framework can be used for 1) analyzing and classifying existing game architectures, which was proven through a systematic review of 40 game architectures, 2) exploring future architectures resulting in the design of a new game architecture, and 3) aiding MDGD. The RAIL and an extended version of RAIL are also themselves valuable research contributions. The RAIL is a DSL for modeling high-level AI in action/adventure games, and the extended RAIL adds network architecture support to RAIL. Both DSLs are supported by their tool-chains including a model-editor, a semantics validator, and a code generator. These two versions of RAIL can be reused in related MDGD projects or be used as the reference DSLs.

Including Visually Impaired Players in a Graphical Adventure Game: A Study of Immersion	The aim of the project presented in this paper is that visually impaired and sighted players should be able to play the same game and share a gaming experience. The goal is that the game should be accessible to visually impaired players without any additional tools, such as text-to-speech, that may reduce the immersion. At the same time, sighted players should perceive the game as a regular game. This paper presents an evaluation of the game where the player immersion has been evaluated through a post test immersion questionnaire. The study was conducted with three independent groups: sighted players using graphics (n=10), blindfolded sighted players (n=10) and visually impaired players (n=9). Although progress in the game and the reported sense of control differed between groups, player immersion was very high in all groups. There were differences between the three groups only in one out of five immersion factors. The result shows that it has been possible to provide an immersive experience irrespective of whether the players are playing the game with graphics or using audio only.

Modeling and formal veri?cation of gaming storylines	Video games are becoming more and more interactive with increasingly complex plots. These plots typically involve multiple parallel storylines that may converge and diverge based on player actions. This may lead to situations that are inconsistent or impassable. Current techniques for planning and testing game plots involve naive means such as text documents, spreadsheets, and critical path testing. Recent academic research [1] [2] [3] examines the design planning problems, but neglect testing and veri?cation of the possible plot lines. These complex plots have thus until now been handled inadequately due to a lack of a formal methodology and tools to support them. In this dissertation, we describe how we develop methods to 1) characterize storylines (SChar), 2) de?ne a storyline description language (SDL), and 3) create a storyline veri?cation tool based in formal veri?cation techniques (StoCk) that use our SDL as input. SChar (Storyline Characterization) help game developers characterize the category of story line they are working on (e.g. linear, branching and plot) through a tool that give a set of guided questions. Our SDL allows its users to describe storylines in a consistent format similar to how they reason about storylines, but in such a way that it can be used for formal veri?cation. StoCk accepts storylines, described in SDL, to be formally veri?ed using SPIN for errors. StoCk is also examined in three common use cases found in the gaming industry used as a tool 1) during storyline creation 2) during quality assurance and 3) during storyline implementation. The combination of SChar, SDL, and StoCk provides designers, writers, and developers a novel methodology and tools to verify consistency in large and complex game plots.

Transitioning from a meta-simulator to electrical applications: An architecture	Nowadays, simulators are used in different applications, such as benchmarking tools, for entertainment and educational purposes, to test scenarios that otherwise would not be possible to analyze (e.g., for security reasons) or to evaluate business and regulatory models. Nevertheless, simulators are usually tailor-made for a specific application. This paper proposes an original approach, an architecture for a software tool capable of simulating any electric power system application, the first energy-oriented meta-simulator. This tool would only require the definition of a set of behavior rules, easing the process of developing new simulators aimed at the energy sector. Its applications range from pure software simulators, that could be used with, for example, benchmarking, decision-making or competition purposes, to applications monitoring and controlling energy assets in real-time, such as hardware devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, or power plants) or digital twins. The proposed architecture resulted by studying previous tools and simulators with the objective of finding common blocks and elements to abstract them. For this reason, the proposed architecture intents to encompass any tool that aims to model the energy sector. Additionally, the proposed architecture is compliant with lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) protocols and smart systems and supports the synchronization with other frameworks at different levels.

Reducing Cognitive Impairment Among Dementia Users Through Mobile Application	Cognitive impairment includes the lacking ability to remember things, disorientation in remembering the current location, and the struggle to find the correct word. People with dementia (PwD) are often involved in this impairment. With that being said, this project proposes the use of a mobile application to help in improving their cognitive issues. To tackle this problem, features and functionality of a mobile application specifically for dementia users are identified which contributes to the development of a diary application. Identifying and gathering features from previous studies was the initial method. Development of the diary application followed the software development life cycle (SDLC) waterfall method and evaluation of the application was experimented with identified dementia users. The findings of this project are the application set of guidelines gathered from literature into the diary application. Four verified dementia people were involved in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the application. The evaluation of the application includes some good points. Some parts of the application are pointed out for their unsuitable design and suggestions are given to improve the application in the later future.		N. A. M. Hassan; A. Baharum; Z. H. A. Sani; K.

Development of a Mobile Application Using Augmentative and Alternative Communication and Video Modelling for Autistic Children	"Purpose: The aim of this project is to report on a mobile application which has integrated
Augmented and Alternative Communication and video modeling approaches. A usability
testing has been conducted on the developed application.
Design/methodology/approach: The authors have developed a mobile application, AutiAct.
In order to do so, an interview has been conducted with teachers. Observations have been made
with 4 ASD children aged 7 to 12 years, each of whom has different types of severity, while
usability tests and interview questions have been conducted with 3 teachers from the National
Autism Society of Malaysia (NASOM) to test the effectiveness of AutiAct.
Findings: A mobile application, AutiAct, has been developed through the introduction of video
modeling and Augmentative Alternative Communication approaches to assist autistic children
in their everyday routine. The procedure in the application is simple and can be followed step
by step for autistic children. Based on the testing, all the respondents have 100% agreed that
AutiAct is an appropriate tool to assist and enhance autism children with their daily life skills.
Results also have shown that video modelling and AAC are an important tool to be used to
improve the abilities of autistic children.
Practical implications: Results have shown that AutiAct is reliable to help autistic children
improve their independent skills so that they will depend less on their parents as they grow
older and that it also embeds a character building for autistic children to help them shape their
personality and characteristics."	Mobile application; Augmented and Alternative Communication; Video Modeling; Autistic Children	W. F. W. Ahmad and N. A. B.

Computational methods for the verification of adaptive control systems	"Intelligent and adaptive control systems will significantly challenge current verification and validation (V&V) processes, tools, and methods for flight certification. Although traditional certification practices have produced safe and reliable flight systems, they will not be cost effective for next-generation autonomous unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) due to inherent size and complexity increases from added functionality. Affordable V&V of intelligent control systems is by far the most important challenge in the development of UAVs faced by both commercial and military aerospace industry in the United States. This paper presents a formal modeling framework for a class of adaptive control systems and an associated computational scheme. The class of systems considered include neural network-based flight control systems and vehicle health management systems. This class of systems and indeed all adaptive systems are hybrid systems whose continuum dynamics is nonlinear. Our computational procedure is iterative and each iteration has two sequential steps. The first step is to derive an approximating finite-state automaton whose behaviors contain the behaviors of the hybrid system. The second step is to check if the language accepted by the approximating automaton is empty (emptiness checking). The iterations are terminated if the language accepted is empty; otherwise, the approximation is refined and the iteration is continued. This procedure will never produce an ""error-free"" certificate when the actual system contains errors which is an important requirement in V&V of safety critical systems."		Prasanth, R., J.

MAR-CPS: Measurable Augmented Reality for Prototyping Cyber-Physical Systems	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) refer to engineering platforms that rely on the inte- gration of physical systems with control, computation, and communication technologies. Autonomous vehicles are instances of CPSs that are rapidly growing with applications in many domains. Due to the integration of physical systems with computational sens- ing, planning, and learning in CPSs, hardware-in-the-loop experiments are an essential step for transitioning from simulations to real-world experiments. This paper proposes an architecture for rapid prototyping of CPSs that has been developed in the Aerospace Controls Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This system, referred to as MAR-CPS (Measurable Augmented Reality for Prototyping Cyber-Physical Systems), includes physical vehicles and sensors, a motion capture technology, a projection system, and a communication network. The role of the projection system is to augment a physical laboratory space with 1) autonomous vehicles' beliefs and 2) a simulated mission environ- ment, which in turn will be measured by physical sensors on the vehicles. The main focus of this method is on rapid design of planning, perception, and learning algorithms for au- tonomous single-agent or multi-agent systems. Moreover, the proposed architecture allows researchers to project a simulated counterpart of outdoor environments in a controlled, indoor space, which can be crucial when testing in outdoor environments is disfavored due to safety, regulatory, or monetary concerns. We discuss the issues related to the design and implementation of MAR-CPS and demonstrate its real-time behavior in a variety of problems in autonomy, such as motion planning, multi-robot coordination, and learning spatio-temporal fields.

Combination of simulation and model-checking for the analysis of autonomous vehicles� behaviors: A case study	Autonomous vehicles� behavioural analysis represents a major challenge in the automotive world. In order to ensure safety and fluidity of driving, various methods are available, in particular, simulation and formal verification. The analysis, however, has to cope with very complex environments depending on many parameters evolving in real time. In this context, none of the aforementioned approaches is fully satisfactory, which lead us to propose a combined methodology in order to point out suspicious behaviours more efficiently. We illustrate this approach by studying a non deterministic scenario involving a vehicle, which has to react to some perilous situation.

Towards Verification of Artificial Neural Networks	"We consider the safety verification of controllers obtained via machine learning. This is an
important problem as the employed machine learning techniques work well in practice, but
cannot guarantee safety of the produced controller, which is typically represented as an artificial
neural network. Nevertheless, such methods are used in safety-critical environments.
In this paper we take a typical control problem, namely the Cart Pole System (a. k. a. inverted
pendulum), and a model of its physical environment and study safety verification of this system.
To do so, we use bounded model checking (BMC). The created formulas are solved with
the SMT-solver iSAT3. We examine the problems that occur during solving these formulas
and show that extending the solver by special deduction routines can reduce both memory
consumption and computation time on such instances significantly. This constitutes a first step
towards verification of machine-learned controllers, but a lot of challenges remain."		Scheibler, K., L. Winterer, R. Wimmer; B. Becker	MBMV, 2015	https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268014938.pdf#page=30		30-40		Google Scholar	2015	Towards Verification of Artificial Neural Networks		CORE
The challenge of verification and testing of machine learning	"In our second post, we gave some background explaining why attacking machine learning is often easier than defending it. We saw some of the reasons why we do not yet have completely effective defenses against adversarial examples, and we speculated about whether we can ever expect such a defense.

In this post, we explore the types of guarantees one can expect a machine learning model to possess. We argue that the limitations of existing defenses point to the lack of verification of machine learning models. Indeed, to design reliable systems, engineers typically engage in both testing and verification:

By testing, we mean evaluating the system in several conditions and observing its behavior, watching for defects.

By verification, we mean producing a compelling argument that the system will not misbehave under a very broad range of circumstances.

Orthogonal to this issue is the question of which input values should be subject to verification and testing. Do we intend to verify or test the system only for �naturally occurring� legitimate inputs, or do we intend to provide guarantees for its behavior on arbitrary, degenerate inputs? Many software systems such as compilers have undefined behavior for some inputs."		Goodfellow, I.; N.

Global-and-local attention networks for visual recognition	Most recent gains in machine vision have originated from the development of network architectures which incorporate some form of attention. While biology is sometimes mentioned as a source of inspiration, the attentional mechanisms that have been considered by the computer vision community remain limited in comparison to the richness and diversity of the processes used by our visual system. Here, we describe a biologicallymotivated �global-and-local attention� (GALA) module which is shown to yield state-of-the-art object recognition accuracy when embedded in a modern deep neural network. We further describe ClickMe.ai, a largescale online experiment designed for human participants to identify diagnostic image regions for visual recognition in order to co-train a GALA network. Adding humans-inthe-loop is shown to significantly improve network accuracy, while also yielding visual representations that are more interpretable and more similar to those used by human observers.

Learning Global Additive Explanations for Neural Nets Using Model Distillation	Interpretability has largely focused on local explanations, i.e. explaining why a model made a particular prediction for a sample. These explanations are appealing due to their simplicity and local fidelity. However, they do not provide information about the general behavior of the model. We propose to leverage model distillation to learn global additive explanations that describe the relationship between input features and model predictions. These global explanations take the form of feature shapes, which are more expressive than feature attributions. Through careful experimentation, we show qualitatively and quantitatively that global additive explanations are able to describe model behavior and yield insights about models such as neural nets.

	Caregiver anecdotes attest that music and photographs play an important role for family members diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), even those with severe AD. Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations.

	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals experience many troubles in communication and lag in social improvement. In this significant circumstance, the appearance of smart technologies has kept promising success regarding Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Many socio-developmental mobile applications have been created in developed countries. In contrast, there are no such applications in developing countries like Bangladesh in native content. In this paper, an Android-based mobile application named HELLO is designed with the fundamental thought of Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) in the Bangla language. This application aims to improve the socio-communicational learnability of autism individuals in Bangladesh. It is expected that our application can be brilliant support to autism individuals, also included the people who endure non-verbal inconveniences. The outcome of this application demonstrates a positive streamline to the improvement in communicating with others.

	Objectives: We developed an adaptive computer assistant for the supervision of diabetics’ self-care, to support limiting illness and need for acute treatment, and improve health literacy. This assistant monitors self-care activities logged in the patient’s electronic diary. Accordingly, it provides context-aware feedback. The objective was to evaluate whether older adults in general can make use of the computer assistant and to compare an adaptive computer assistant with a fixed one, concerning its usability and contribution to health literacy. Methods: We conducted a laboratory experiment in the Georgia Tech Aware Home wherein 28 older adults participated in a usability evaluation of the computer assistant, while engaged in scenarios reflecting normal and health-critical situations. We evaluated the assistant on effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, and educational value. Finally, we studied the moderating effects of the subjects’ personal characteristics. Results: Logging self-care tasks and receiving feedback from the computer assistant enhanced the subjects’ knowledge of diabetes. The adaptive assistant was more effective in dealing with normal and health-critical situations, and, generally, it led to more time efficiency. Subjects’ personal characteristics had substantial effects on the effectiveness and efficiency of the two computer assistants. Conclusions: Older adults were able to use the adoptive computer assistant. In addition, it had a positive effect on the development of health literacy. The assistant has the potential to support older diabetics’ self care while maintaining quality of life. © 2008 Schattauer GmbH.,” vol. 47, no. 1, pp. 82–88, 2008, doi: 10.3414/ME9105.												
	Childhood obesity has now reached an alarming level among children. It affects one out of every ten children all over the world. While in Malaysia, overweight child is 38 percent of the child population. If it is not effectively curbed, childhood obesity will cause many problems. Previous studies have shown that parents are responsible for their children’s well-being and their involvement is the most influential treatment to childhood obesity. With the advent of mobile technology, various mobile apps have been developed to manage people’s daily lives. This paper elaborates on the development of the BMI monitor app, a mobile application which is intended to be used by parents to monitor their children’s Body Mass Index (BMI). It uses the BMI Percentile method which is recommended by pediatricians worldwide. This app enables parents to store all the BMI records of the children and also provides advices to help parents to deal with the childhood obesity problems. This paper also discusses on the outcome of an evaluation that has been conducted among a sample of parents towards the use of the app. It is hoped that the use of the app will ease the parents in monitoring their children’s BMI status and eventually formed them to be more responsible parents.,” vol. 96, no. 1–2, pp. 367–376, 2016.												
	This paper describes an interdisciplinary approach towards a framework for personalized, game-based training programs for elderly and handicapped people. Adaptation and personalization are proposed as a way to increase the physiological training effects of game-based training programs (exergames). Hereby, the diversity of users and a broad range of physiological handicaps are considered. The framework is based on scientific training programs enhanced by technical methods and concepts for personalized exergames. This includes an authoring environment (StoryTec) which supports game designers and domain experts (sport scientists, medical doctors, therapists, etc.) in the development process and the (personalized) configuration of such exergames. Two prototypically implemented applications (ErgoActive and BalanceFit) demonstrate the usability and adaptation of the underlying training and game concepts for different user groups and provide indicators of the effectiveness and efficiency of the generic framework for particular user groups. For instance, ErgoActive is applicable for people of all ages and both trained and untrained users by being able to provide personalized training levels to improve endurance. Similarly, BalanceFit is useful both for wheelchair and walking frame users in order to maintain and possibly even increase their balance, strength and muscular coordination.												
	Personal, mobile displays, such as those on mobile phones, are ubiquitous, yet for the most part, underutilized. We present results from a field experiment that investigated the effectiveness of these displays as a means for improving awareness of daily life (in our case, self-monitoring of physical activity). Twenty-eight participants in three experimental conditions used our UbiFit system for a period of three months in their day-to-day lives over the winter holiday season. Our results show, for example, that participants who had an awareness display were able to maintain their physical activity level (even during the holidays), while the level of physical activity for participants who did not have an awareness display dropped significantly. We discuss our results and their general implications for the use of everyday mobile devices as awareness displays.												
	A sedentary lifestyle is a contributing factor to chronic diseases, and it is often correlated with obesity. To promote an increase in physical activity, we created a social computer game, Fish’n’Steps, which links a player’s daily foot step count to the growth and activity of an animated virtual character, a fish in a fish tank. As further encouragement, some of the players’ fish tanks included other players’ fish, thereby creating an environment of both cooperation and competition. In a fourteen-week study with nineteen participants, the game served as a catalyst for promoting exercise and for improving game players’ attitudes towards physical activity. Furthermore, although most player’s enthusiasm in the game decreased after the game’s first two weeks, analyzing the results using Prochaska’s Transtheoretical Model of Behavioral Change suggests that individuals had, by that time, established new routines that led to healthier patterns of physical activity in their daily lives. Lessons learned from this study underscore the value of such games to encourage rather than provide negative reinforcement, especially when individuals are not meeting their own expectations, to foster long-term behavioral change.
