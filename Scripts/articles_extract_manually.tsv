Role-Playing Computer Game to Improve Speech Ability of Down Syndrome Children	"Down syndrome individuals are known to have difficulties in speech, both in pronunciation of words and making
sentences, due to the innate physical impairment of their mouth muscles and their cognitive and intelligence
limitations. An interesting finding by other researchers shows that the vocabulary acquisition rates of these individuals fall
between the range of average to slow, and they hardly use good grammar, although they seem to have good
understanding of casual conversation. However, most research efforts have been dedicated to enhancing their words
recognition ability and computer applications have been developed for reading therapy, whereas the syntax and
expressive language training are rarely focused. In this paper, we propose the use of role playing computer game featuring
state-of-the-art speech recognition technology as an attempt to improve the speech accuracy of down syndrome children in
terms of grammar. The challenges involved the input received in coordinating the speech accuracy. We provide systematic
review on some of the base elements to consider while developing the game for the mildly-impaired down syndrome
individuals, which includes speech recognition technology, cognitive psychology, instructional design models, system
development life cycle, and multimedia in special education."	"Down Syndrome; Multimedia Applications; Serious Game; Speech Training"	"Che Pee, A. N.; Abdullah, M. H. L.; Zakaria, M.

Usability evaluation of the domain specific language for spatial simulation scenarios	This article presents the results of a usability evaluation initiative conducted on the Domain Specific Language for Spatial Simulation Scenarios (short name DSL3S) and its supporting tools. This language applies a Model-Driven Development approach to spatial simulation, providing model development through the composition of graphical elements and the subsequent transformation to source code. Potential users trained in disciplines related to Geographic Information Systems were exposed for a first time to the language with an introductory exercise. After installing the supporting tools and developing a simple spatial simulation model, participants then evaluated the language and its tools by answering a questionnaire. The results of this evaluation point to a good degree of usability, with particularly positive appreciations of the DSL3S supporting tools. Notwithstanding, participants also show some reluctance in adopting such a development framework, hinting at some reminiscent scepticism towards domain specific modelling languages and Model-Driven Development.

Stay Awhile and Listen to 3Buddy, a Co-creative Level Design Support Tool	"There is untapped potential in having a computer work as a colleague with the video game level designer as a source of
creative stimuli, instead of simply working as his slave. This paper presents 3Buddy, a co-creative level design tool exploring this digital peer paradigm, aimed at fostering creativity by allowing human and computer to work together in the context of level design, and describes a case study of the approach to
produce content using the Legend of Grimrock 2 level editor. Suggestions are generated and iteratively evolved by multiple inter-communicating genetic algorithms guiding three different domains: innovation (exploring new directions), guidelines (respecting specific design goals) and convergence (focusing on current co-proposal). The interface allows the designer to orient the tool behaviour in the space defined by these dimensions. This paper details the inner workings of the system and presents an exploratory study showing, on the one hand, how the tool was used differently by professional and amateur level designers, and on the other hand, how the nuances of the co-creative interaction through an intentionoriented interface may be a source of positive influence for the creative level design process."

Pricing and Upgrade Strategies for Software Vendors in the Software-as-a-Service Market 	"This study examines the competition between an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers a standard fixed-price software product and a cloud software vendor (CSV)
who adopts a usage-based linear pricing scheme for its cloud-based software. Using a game theoretic approach, we set up a duopoly model to derive the optimal pricing and
product feature choice decisions for both the ISV and the CSV in a market characterized with heterogeneous consumer preferences for software features, and different risk
structures. Next, we plan to extend the duopoly model into a two-stage game and examine how the equilibrium outcomes change when we allow both vendors to exercise
their software upgrade strategies. The results of our study will provide important implications to vendors and consumers in software markets where the Software-as-aService (SaaS) business model began to prevail and contribute to the growing literature on economics of cloud computing.

Kinematic Simulation of a Line Follower Robot for the Creation of the Programming Videogame Rusty Roads in the Unity Framework	This paper presents the results of a research project for developing Rusty Roads, a videogame that simulates line follower robots in tridimensional, competitive environments. During the software development process, it was necessary to define the key physical factors that could affect the performance of the robot. A real robot was considered to define real parameters for the simulation, and to define discrete equations for simulating the robot in the Unity framework, comparing their accuracy with that of continuous, exact equations specifically developed for this study. This paper presents the process for obtaining and testing those equations, which were the foundations for the successful development of the simulation layer of the videogame and allowed the subsequent creation of its 3D visualization component.

Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification	The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely used to synchronize computer clocks in the Internet. This document describes NTP version 4 (NTPv4), which is backwards compatible with NTP version 3 (NTPv3), described in RFC 1305, as well as previous versions of the protocol. NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family. NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs. It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required. It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]		"Mills, D.; J.

The Design, Play, and Experience Framework	This chapter introduces a framework for the design of serious games for learning, called the design, play, and experience framework. The author argues that the great potential of serious games will not be realized without a formal design approach. To that end, the author presents and thoroughly explains the design, play, and experience framework which provides a formal approach to designing the learning, storytelling, game play, user experience, and technology components of a serious game. The author concludes by detailing how the framework provides a common language to discuss serious game design, a methodology to analyze a design, and a process to design a serious game for learning.

From Knowing It to ÔøΩGetting ItÔøΩ: Envisioning Practices in Computer Games Development	"The development of information systems and software applications increasingly needs to deliver culturally rich and affective experiences for user groups. In this paper, we explore how the collaborative practices across different expert groups can enable this experiential dimension of use to be integrated into the development of a software product. In an empirical study of computer games developmentÔøΩan arena in which the novelty and richness of the user experience is central to competitive successÔøΩwe identify the challenges of conceptualizing and realizing a desired user experience when it cannot be readily specified in an initial design template, nor represented within the expertise of existing groups. Our study develops a theoretical framework to address these challenges. Through this framework, we are able to show how achieving a desired user experience requires developer groups to not only work across the boundaries that arise from specialized expertise, but also across wider fields centred on cultural production and software development, respectively. We find that their ability to do this is supported by distinctive ÔøΩenvisioning practicesÔøΩ that sustain an emerging shared ÔøΩvisionÔøΩ for each game. The key research contributions that we then make are (a) grounding envisioning practices as a means of theorizing the collaborative practices centred on conceptualizing the user experience; (b) identifying how these practices are interwoven with the ÔøΩproducing practicesÔøΩ of software development, thus enabling collaboration to span expert groups and disparate fields; and (c) theorizing the role of vision as an emerging conceptual boundary object in these practices."

Controlling the uncontrollable: ÔøΩAgileÔøΩ teams and illusions of autonomy in creative work	The creative industries have recently been hailed as presenting a liberating model for the future of work and a valuable terrain on which to examine purported new regimes of workplace control. This article, based on the empirical examination of a Canadian video game development studio, traces the modes of control which operate on and through project teams in creative settings. The impact of the adoption of an ÔøΩemancipatoryÔøΩ, post-bureaucratic project management technology, ÔøΩAgileÔøΩ, is critically examined through interviews and non-participative observation of management, technical and artistic labour within one project team. The potential for autonomy in such ÔøΩAgileÔøΩ teams is critically assessed within the managerial regime of creative production and the broader power relations implied by the financial, organizational and institutional context.

The politics of ÔøΩplatformsÔøΩ	Online content providers such as YouTube are carefully positioning themselves to users, clients, advertisers and policymakers, making strategic claims for what they do and do not do, and how their place in the information landscape should be understood. One term in particular, ÔøΩplatformÔøΩ, reveals the contours of this discursive work. The term has been deployed in both their populist appeals and their marketing pitches, sometimes as technical ÔøΩplatformsÔøΩ, sometimes as ÔøΩplatformsÔøΩ from which to speak, sometimes as ÔøΩplatformsÔøΩ of opportunity. Whatever tensions exist in serving all of these constituencies are carefully elided. The term also fits their efforts to shape information policy, where they seek protection for facilitating user expression, yet also seek limited liability for what those users say. As these providers become the curators of public discourse, we must examine the roles they aim to play, and the terms by which they hope to be judged.

Danish TV Christmas calendars: Folklore, myth and cultural history	This article aims at characterizing the Danish Christmas calendar as a TV institution and a meeting place for the traditions of the almanac, folklore and the history of culture. Against the background of a brief outline of the history of Danish Christmas calendars, the article explores ways in which this traditional genre has succeeded in renewing itself. The so-called Pyrus series, TV 2ÔøΩs Christmas calendars during the mid-1990s, exhibited folklore, myth and cultural history in a combination of entertainment and information. They were succeeded by calendars such as Jul i Valhal/ÔøΩChristmas in ValhallaÔøΩ (2005), Absalons hemmelighed/ÔøΩThe Secret of AbsalonÔøΩ (2006), Mikkel og guldkortet/ÔøΩMikkel and the Golden CardÔøΩ (2008) and Pagten/ÔøΩThe CovenantÔøΩ (2009). Some of these added cultural criticism to the repertoire of the genre.

Software Licenses in Context: The Challenge of Heterogeneously-Licensed Systems	"The prevailing approach to free/open source software and licenses has been that each system is developed, distributed, and used under the terms of a single license. But it is increasingly common for information systems and other software to be composed with components from a variety of sources, and with a diversity of licenses. This may result in possible license conflicts and organizational liability for failure to fulfill license obligations. Research and practice to date have not kept up with this sea-change in software licensing arising from free/open source software development. System consumers and users consequently rely on ad hoc heuristics (or costly legal advice) to determine which license rights and obligations are in effect, often with less than optimal results; consulting services are offered to identify unknowing unauthorized use of licensed software in information systems; and researchers have shown how the choice of a (single) specific license for a product affects project success and system adoption. Legal scholars have examined how pairs of software licenses conflict but only in simple contexts. We present an approach for understanding and modeling software licenses, as well as for analyzing conflicts among groups of licenses in realistic system contexts, and for guiding the acquisition, integration, or development of systems with free/open source components in such an environment. This work is based on an empirical analysis of representative software licenses and of heterogeneously-licensed systems. Our approach provides guidance for achieving a ÔøΩbest-of-breedÔøΩ component strategy while obtaining desired license rights in exchange for acceptable obligations."

Method for Game Development Driven by User-eXperience: A Study of Rework, Productivity and Complexity of Use	The growing capabilities and revenues of video game development are important factors for software companies. However, game development processes could be considered immature, specifically in the design phase. Ambiguous requirements in game design cause rework. User-eXperience (UX) is usually assessed at the end of the development process, causing difficulties to ensure the interactive experience between the game and users. To reduce these problems, this paper proposes a method for Game Development driven by User-eXperience (GameD-UX) that integrates a repository based on requirements engineering, a model for user experience management, and an adjusted agile process. Two experiments were conducted to study rework and productivity of video game development. Results of the first experiment revealed that GameD-UX causes less rework than conventional approaches, but it induces lower productivity. A tool for supporting the GameD-UX method was developed by considering the lessons learned. The second experiment showed that the software tool increases the productivity and reduces the complexity of use of GameD-UX.

E.GRAPHIC (GAMES RESEARCH APPLIED TO PUBLIC HEALTH WITH INNOVATIVE COLLABORATION) - DESIGNING A SERIOUS GAME PILOT FOR DENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH	Educators are looking towards new methods of engaging and motivating students and encouraging self-directed life-long learning in preparing undergraduates to enter the dental profession. This paper's objective is to report the development of an online collaborative serious game as an e-learning Dental Public Health resource for dental undergraduates. GRAPHIC involved the development of a pilot computer game programme. The game was housed within the Moodle environment. In the game students worked collaboratively to consider the views of key stakeholders in the community and individually to explore population oral health, and the evidence base for community initiatives. The pilot programme was used by students in January 2012 with positive feedback. The learning outcomes of the game were achieved with all students successfully passing the game. The development of a pilot game has demonstrated the effective use of technology enhanced learning in dental public health. The pilot programme demonstrates the potential of using gaming as a teaching tool in dental public health. Learning from the pilot is contributing to further developments including an improved user interface.

Defining an Iterative ISO/IEC 29110 Deployment Package for Game Developers	Software development in a small development team is a challenge, as people have to fulfill several roles, which in larger groups would have dedicated people. To help in this aspect, the ISO/IEC 29110 Lifecycle profiles for Very Small Entities has been developed to help organization and manage the workflow. However, the model presented in the ISO/IEC 29110 is rather abstract, and prominently follows the waterfall approach, even though the documents do amend agile practices as one acceptable approach. In game development this loosely defined approach is problematic, since games industry heavily relies in the agile practices with short cycles of iterations. In this article, the authors present their study of game development organizations, and describe the ISO/IEC 29110 deployment package ÔøΩHighly Iterative Software ProcessesÔøΩ which combines the Entry level model with the industry-specific requirements. In general, the definition of support for the iterative development makes the model feasible for the industry.

Introduction of a process maturity model for market-driven product management and requirements engineering	The area of software product development of software intensive products has received much attention, especially in the area of requirements engineering and product management. Many companies are faced with new challenges when operating in an environment where potential requirements number in thousands or even tens of thousands, and where a product does not have a customer, but any number of customers or markets. The development organization carries not only all the costs of development, but also takes all the risks. In this environment traditional bespoke requirements engineering, together with traditional process assessment and improvement models fall short as they do not address the unique challenges of a market-driven environment. This paper introduces the Market-driven Requirements Engineering Process Model, aimed at enabling process improvement and process assurance for organizations faced with these new challenges. The model is also validated in the industry through three case studies where the model is used for process assessment and improvement suggestion. Initial results show that the model is appropriate for process improvement for organizations operating in a market-driven environment. In addition, the model was designed to be light weight in terms of low cost and thus adapted not only for large organizations but suitable for small and medium enterprises as well.

Doors and Perception: Fiction vs. Simulation in Games	"In this paper, the author outlines a theory of the relationship of fictional, virtual and real elements in games. Not much critical attention has been paid to the concept of fiction when applied to games and game worlds, despite many books, articles and papers using the term, often in the title. Here, it is argued that game worlds and their objects are ontologically different from fictional worlds; they are empirically upheld by the game engine, rather than by our mind stimulated by verbal information. Game phenomena such as labyrinths, moreover, are evidence that games contain elements that are just as real as their equivalents outside the game, and far from equal to the fictional counterparts."

Game Engines and Game History	I have a problem: itÔøΩs called preaching to the choir.  Nobody here lacks faith in the history of games, and I can only hope that my talk will not reduce your enthusiasm.  That realization eliminates the need for a homily on the value of historical studies.  Instead, I will talk about the possibilities and promises facing the history of games as we plunge forward. What does history offer game studies and what might a history of games give back? These questions guide my thoughts at the end of this conference, which has given so much food for these thoughts.

Beyond the HUD - User Interfaces for Increased Player Immersion in FPS Games	The concept of immersion has been adapted by game developers and game critics to describe a deep and positive game experience. While the definition of this concept varies, the user interface of the game is often said to affect the degree to which players can immerse themselves in a game experience. In cooperation with game developer EA DICE, this master thesis aims to investigate how the notion of immersion affects, and is affected by, the user interface (UI) of first-person shooter games, with the ultimate purpose of delivering user interface guidelines for increased immersion. By conducting a study of contemporary first-person shooter (FPS) games, the current state of user interfaces in FPS games is documented. With the addition of a subjective study of FPS games as well as games of other genres, a design space for UI designers is mapped out in order to provide a structure upon which the guidelines can be built. A literature study of various resources within the fields of ludology, cognitive science and media studies is conducted in order to gain increased understanding of what immersion is and its relation to the game experience. The knowledge acquired is used to formulate various hypotheses of how player immersion is connected to the user interfaces of FPS games. These hypotheses are evaluated by user studies and user tests. Looking at the results of the user tests and the literature study, a final definition of immersion is proposed, upon which the guidelines are based. The first guideline, Know Your Design Space, explains the user interface design space of FPS games and encourages UI designers to look at it as a set of tools. Know Your Game discusses how the competitive focus of the game and the game fiction affects the user interface from an immersion point of view. The guideline Establish Player Agency focuses on how the player can be transferred into the game world by acting within it as an agent rather than simply a player of the game. Finally, Strengthen the Player-Avatar Perceptual Link suggests how the user interface can link the player closer to his in-game character on a perceptual level.

Understanding Reliability and Validity in Qualitative Research	The use of reliability and validity are common in quantitative research and now it is reconsidered in the qualitative research paradigm. Since reliability and validity are rooted in positivist perspective then they should be redefined for their use in a naturalistic approach. Like reliability and validity as used in quantitative research are providing springboard to examine what these two terms mean in the qualitative research paradigm, triangulation as used in quantitative research to test the reliability and validity can also illuminate some ways to test or maximize the validity and reliability of a qualitative study. Therefore, reliability, validity and triangulation, if they are relevant research concepts, particularly from a qualitative point of view, have to be redefined in order to reflect the multiple ways of establishing truth.

Keeping the Game Alive: Evaluating Strategies for the Preservation of Console Video Games	"Interactive fiction and video games are part of our cultural heritage. As original systems cease to work because of hardware and media failures, methods to preserve obsolete video games for future generations have to be developed. The public interest in early video games is high, as exhibitions, regular magazines on the topic and newspaper articles demonstrate. Moreover, games considered to be classic are rereleased for new generations of gaming hardware. However, with the rapid development of new computer systems, the way games look and are played changes constantly. When trying to preserve console video games one faces problems of classified development documentation, legal aspects and extracting the contents from original media like cartridges with special hardware. Furthermore, special controllers and non-digital items are used to extend the gaming experience making it difficult to preserve the look and feel of console video games.

This paper discusses strategies for the digital preservation of console video games. After a short overview of console video game systems, there follows an introduction to digital preservation and related work in common strategies for digital preservation and preserving interactive art. Then different preservation strategies are described with a specific focus on emulation. Finally a case study on console video game preservation is shown which uses the Planets preservation planning approach for evaluating preservation strategies in a documented decision-making process. Experiments are carried out to compare different emulators as well as other approaches, first for a single console video game system, then for different console systems of the same era and finally for systems of all eras. Comparison and discussion of results show that, while emulation works very well in principle for early console video games, various problems exist for the general use as a digital preservation alternative. We show what future work has to be done to tackle these problems."

Onward Through the Fog: Computer Game Collection and the Play of Obsolescence	"In Mardi and a Voyage Thither, novelist Herman Melville writes of the peculiar and startling confluence of memory, objects, valuation, and disfigurement that mark the collector of obsoletia. The storyÔøΩs antiquary is the picture of perverse depletion, with a body ÔøΩcrooked, and dwarfed, and surmounted by a hump, that sat on his back like a burdenÔøΩ (328), his hut in shambles, and ÔøΩthe precious antiques, and curios, and obsoletesÔøΩÔøΩthe objects of his collectionÔøΩÔøΩstrewn about, all dusty and disorderedÔøΩ (329). This unkempt display cum impromptu museum turns out to present a mere fraction of the curatorÔøΩs collection, the rest of which is host to countless subtle molds and ravenous worms in a vast catacomb below ground. Traversing this darkened vault, one visitor says, is ÔøΩlike going down to posterityÔøΩ (332).

As inveterate accumulators ourselves, we can certainly relate to MardiÔøΩs ""extraordinary antiquarian"": pursuing obsolete things has transformed us too (though hopefully not quite so hideously), as well as the work we do and the spaces we do it in. Since 1999, we have been collectingÔøΩand subsequently lending out to scholars the world overÔøΩcomputer games, systems, and game-related paraphernalia. By recent estimates, our Learning Games Initiative Archive contains more than 20,000 artifacts, from Venezuelan Pong clones to Mario-themed lollipops. Archival work at this scale and with this diversity is not easy, and it constantly butts up against a host of intractable questions. For example, what does it mean to isolate a thing that no longer has its original value but has taken on a new one? When researchers hold such transmuted artifacts up for inspection, what are they looking for and how might archivists help them to find it? Is the primary work of computer game archivists (and indeed archivists of all types) to protect artifacts from the elements, to enjoin them upon their kin, and to guard over the collection for the sake of some abstract posterity, or is it something more collaborative and communal? Finally, is it possible for research-oriented collectors to engage the process of collection without suffering the deformations of skin and soul (not to mention pocketbook) that often plague the more solipsistic acquirer?

We offer this article as an entrÔøΩe to these questions, as a way to begin to attend to some of the theoretical and practical complexities of obsolescence and its negotiation. We do so primarily by focusing on where those complexities intersect with computer games, the new media we collect and study."

Twisty Little Passages Almost All Alike: Applying the FRBR Model to a Classic Computer Game.	Humanities scholars and librarians both confront questions regarding the boundaries of texts and the relationships between various editions, translations and adaptations. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) Final Report from the International Federation of Library Associations has provided the library community with a model for addressing these questions in the bibliographic systems they create. The Preserving Virtual Worlds project has been investigating FRBR's potential as a model for the description of computer games and interactive fiction. While FRBR provides an attractive theoretical model, the complexity of computer games as works makes its application to such software creations problematic in practice.

Developing Digital Games through Software Reuse	"Gaming is an old humansÔøΩ habit. Games help in logical development and encourage learning of theoretical and practical concepts. Besides they offer entertainment
and challenge. The advent of the personal computer changed this tradition. Every year new challenges arise in a digital format, which lead the young and adults to spend hours
in front of a computer or TV screen in an attempt to overcome hurdles and reach an objective. Quality, sophistication, and constant innovation are attained through complex
computer software that almost has an obligation to improve as each new title is released, due to this game development becomes a challenge. Considering that a game title is
software and thus faces the same restrictions of business applications, this article intends to analyze, under the optics of reuse, if game development resorts to reuse, and where and how this happens.

Work for Play: Careers in Video Game Development	"Video games are not only for play; they also provide work. Making video games is a serious--and big--business. Creating these games is complex and requires the collaboration of many developers, who perform a variety of tasks, from production to programming. They work for both small and large game studios to create games that can be played on many different devices, including console systems, computers, and cell phones. This article covers career options in video game development. The first section provides an overview of the development process. The second section describes four groups of video game occupations: designers, programmers, artists, and others. The third section covers the skills and training workers need for these jobs. The fourth section discusses the benefits and challenges of working in the video game industry. And the fifth section provides job-seeking tips for a career in video game development.

An MDA?based framework for collaborative business process modelling	"Purpose
This paper aims to present a new approach for developing a framework based on a model driven architecture (MDA) for the modelling of technology?independent collaborative processes.

Design/methodology/approach
The paper suggests a new collaborative process modelling approach based on an MDA and a metamodelling technique. The research method, based on the design science approach, was started by identifying the characteristics of the collaborative processes, which distinguish them from the classical intraorganizational ones. Then, the generic collaborative business process (CBP) modelling framework is developed based on MDA approach and definition of a set of transformation rules through three layers: business, process, and technical. After that, the core component of the framework was the proposition of a generic CBP metamodel at PIM/MDA level. The specific collaboration participant's business processes (expressed as BPMN model) are generated from the generic CBP model represented as an UML2 Profile activity diagram, which is compliant to CBP metamodel. Finally, as proof?of?concept, the architecture of an Eclipse?based open development platform is developed implementing an e?Procurement collaborative process.

Findings
The proposed framework for CBP modelling and the generic CBP metamodel contribute towards a more efficient methodology and have consequences for BPM?related collaboration, facilitating the B2B processes modelling and implementation. In order to demonstrate and evaluate the practical applicability of the framework, the architecture of an Eclipse?based open development platform is developed implementing a collaborative business application on the basis of an e?Procurement use case.

Research limitations/implications
There is a need to focus future research efforts on the improvement of the semi?automatic transformation phase from public to private processes which needs human intervention by adding a suitable interfaces at both sides of the B2B interaction. In addition, the problem of semantic heterogeneities regarding the partner's business process elements (business documents, activity/task names) should be tackled by developing an approach that uses ontology.

Practical implications
Business processes developers find a B2B technology?independent solution for implementing and using interorganizational information systems.

Originality/value
The paper provides a framework that enables the CBP modelling and integrates a generic CBP metamodel. Currently, to the best of the authors' knowledge, such a generic metamodel and his instantiation have not so far been developed."

Comparison of a Traditional and a Video Game Based Balance Training Program	"The aim of the present study is to compare the efficiency of traditional and video game based balance training programs. 22 customers of a health care
centre (age: M = 47.6 yrs; SD = 13.1) volunteered to participate in the experiment. They were randomly assigned to two experimental groups. One group underwent a traditional training program, while the other group trained using the Nintendo Wii Fit TM Balance Board. Between pre and post test procedures, training sessions were performed three times a week for three weeks. In addition to five balance tests (SEBT, ball-handling, two video games, dynamic balance), a questionnaire was applied concerning mood state, self-efficacy, physical activity enjoyment, flow and subjective experience in order to evaluate psychological effects of the interventions. Two-factor analyses of variance showed both general and differential improvements of the two groups for pre and post test measures. Both groups improved their balance performance in 4 of five tests. The traditional group showed a significantly greater improvement in two tests (SEBT: F(1,20) = 8.907, p = .007, ?2 = .308; ball-handling: F(1,20) = 13.578, p = .001, ?2 = .404),
whereas the Wii group showed a significantly greater improvement in one test (Ski Slalom (F(1,20) = 5.101, p = .035, ?2 = .203). Psychological questionnaires revealed neither significant pre-post effects nor differences between the groups for pre and post test measurements. The results confirm that the Nintendo Wii Fit TM may be a suitable medium
of training balance in prevention and rehabilitation of adults. Specific effects of training are more pronounced than transfer between virtual and real performance.

Game design tools: Time to evaluate	The art form of the video game has a very idiosyncratic reliance on the process and practice of its designers. We work with creative and computational problems that form a web of deep complexity. And yet, as I have noticed in my professional practice as a game designer, we do not use tools to support our design process. For more than a decade, designers and researchers have argued for the development and use of both conceptual and concrete tools. To this end, formal and semi-formal game design models have been proposed and, more recently, experimental software-based tools have been developed by the research community. To date, however, none of these tools or models have been adopted into mainstream practice within the game design community. In this paper I argue that it is difficult, if not methodologically flawed, to assess the work in the field of game design support without more qualitative data on how such tools fare in actual game design practice. Evaluation research would be an essential contribution towards answering the question of whether ÔøΩ and if so, how - these experimental formal models and tools can support and improve the game design process.

Modeling and formal veri?cation of gaming storylines	Video games are becoming more and more interactive with increasingly complex plots. These plots typically involve multiple parallel storylines that may converge and diverge based on player actions. This may lead to situations that are inconsistent or impassable. Current techniques for planning and testing game plots involve naive means such as text documents, spreadsheets, and critical path testing. Recent academic research [1] [2] [3] examines the design planning problems, but neglect testing and veri?cation of the possible plot lines. These complex plots have thus until now been handled inadequately due to a lack of a formal methodology and tools to support them. In this dissertation, we describe how we develop methods to 1) characterize storylines (SChar), 2) de?ne a storyline description language (SDL), and 3) create a storyline veri?cation tool based in formal veri?cation techniques (StoCk) that use our SDL as input. SChar (Storyline Characterization) help game developers characterize the category of story line they are working on (e.g. linear, branching and plot) through a tool that give a set of guided questions. Our SDL allows its users to describe storylines in a consistent format similar to how they reason about storylines, but in such a way that it can be used for formal veri?cation. StoCk accepts storylines, described in SDL, to be formally veri?ed using SPIN for errors. StoCk is also examined in three common use cases found in the gaming industry used as a tool 1) during storyline creation 2) during quality assurance and 3) during storyline implementation. The combination of SChar, SDL, and StoCk provides designers, writers, and developers a novel methodology and tools to verify consistency in large and complex game plots.

Game Design by Numbers: Instrumental Play and the Quantitative Shift in the Digital Game Industry	"This dissertation chronicles ideological, technological and economic changes in the digital game industry, focusing on how games are transforming as play becomes
instrumentalized. It pays particular attention to the struggles of developers as they search for creative freedom and autonomy in a risk-averse industry. It makes original
contributions to the literature on games by situating and explaining industiy-wide shifts in terms of the socio-economics of game development and the rationalities that drive
individual developers. It contributes to social theory more generally by explaining how transformations in play, games, and creativity are linked to much wider adaptations in the
operation of capitalism and how it is justified to both workers and consumers. I use ground-level accounts from those within the game industry to describe how new media technologies interact with socio-economic forces, detailing the adaptability of capitalist modes of production in the face of critique. I show how definitions of 'games'
and 'play' are changing as they come into contact with technology, allowing games to be reformulated in powerful new ways, so games are not only tools of entertainment but also tools of governance. I argue that the collective valuation of objective quantitative data and the belief in the fallibility of individual creative autonomy has turned game design into ""design by numbers"". The complementary themes of this thesis are bound together by references to the ""New Spirit of Capitalism"" (Boltanski and Chiapello 2007, 2005), which explains how capitalism is continually reorganizing itself, adapting the language and spirit of 1960s counterculture and emphasizing freedom in order to drive though new, more efficient, work practices and more subde forms of exploitation. This ""New Spirit"" accounts for the current upheavals in the game industry. Changes to the Spirit of Capitalism have initiated tectonic shifts, reforming the geography of the game industry and creating fissures in the landscape that allow new game sectors to emerge, while others struggle to avoid being buried. In turn, innovations from the game industry, particularly the emphasis on datadriven design, shore up the weaknesses in the New Spirit of Capitalism, allowing it to operate more successfully."

Usability of Web sites, methods and evaluation techniques	In the present society, the relevance of the Web is unquestionable and there is a great variety of Web sites that offer services to users. In this context, usability plays a fundamental role in the process of developing successful Web sites. In this article we review different definitions about the discipline of usability, its incorporation in the engineering process (usability engineering) and its relation to software engineer, as well as its attributes and evaluation methods. The considerations about the evaluation system of the Web usability are also presented, advising the user and basing it in the establishment of critical tasks (SIRIUS, reviewed by the authors).

Jumping the Gap: Indie Labour and the Imagined Indie Community	Due to the recent proliferation of free-to-use, professional-quality development tools, crowdsourced fundraising, and the ascendency of digital distribution platforms, ÔøΩindieÔøΩ digital game developers are emerging on an unprecedented scale. Based on ethnographic research conducted at indie accelerator Execution Labs from January to June of 2015, this thesis explores how indie developers frame risk, creativity, success, and failure in relation to the communities they are a part of. The first three chapters highlight useful concepts from Gina NeffÔøΩs ÔøΩVenture LabourÔøΩ (2012), describe Execution Labs from the researcherÔøΩs perspective, and detail the researcherÔøΩs approach to collaborative embedded ethnography, respectively. The fourth chapter is dedicated to two related purposes: the first part will posit that communities of indie developers and indie fans share a common creative discourse, and thus constitute what Benedict Anderson has termed an ÔøΩImagined CommunityÔøΩ (2006). The latter portion of the chapter will explore how Newgrounds.com facilitated discourses about digital games and Macromedia Flash, and how the resultant imagined communities have influenced contemporary indie identity and development practice. The final chapter opens by proposing a definition of ÔøΩindie labourÔøΩ: a creative, communitarian strategy with which indie developers manage the risks they face. It will then consider the stories of those who performed indie labour as part of Execution Labs. This thesis will conclude by ruminating on potential future avenues of study and ongoing issues that hinder indie developmentÔøΩs potential as an open and accessible praxis.

Bomberman as an Artificial Intelligence Platform	"Computer games have a long tradition in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. They serve the purpose of establishing challenging goals with long term positive repercussions, with researchers trying to develop AIs capable of beating the world human experts. They also provide a good amount of exposition in mainstream media, whilst also giving an engaging environment for teaching computer science concepts in general and AI methods in particular. This thesis aims precisely to contribute to the educational gaming landscape, by providing a novel Bomberman themed platform and several associated intelligent agents. Our first major contribution is precisely the platform itself, Bomberman
as an Artificial Intelligence Platform (BAIP). We provide a fully functional opensource, graphical, language agnostic platform, aimed towards facilitating the study and development of AI methods. We showcase the potential of BAIP and the richness of the selected game environment by developing a plethora of AI agents using different methodologies. At an initial level we introduce a set of basic heuristic methods capable of providing agents with the most essential behavior primitives, equipping them for basic survival in the game environment. At a more advanced level we introduce search-based methods capable of some form of planning. From a machine learning perspective we show how BAIP can be integrated and used with Reinforcement Learning (RL). We use a simple RL problem within the platform and implement both Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms in order to tackle it. This thesis also provides detailed and thorough experimental results about all the developed agents and methods, using the developed platform capabilities. To sum up, this work introduces a new AI platform, gives a strong baseline agent and demonstrates the feasibility of using it for machine learning tasks."

Requirements Engineering in Scrum Framework	Requirement Engineering (RE) plays an important role in the success of software development life cycle. As RE is the starting point of the life cycle, any changes in requirements will be costly and time consuming. Failure in determining accurate requirements leads to errors in specifications and therefore to a mal system architecture. In addition, most of software development environments are characterized by user requests to change some requirements.Scrum as one of agile development methods that gained a great attention because of its ability to deal with the changing environments. This paper presents and discusses the current situation of RE activities in Scrum, how Scrum benefits from RE techniques and future challenges in this respect.

We have been software developers, managers in IT organizations and software product companies, and owners of both product companies and service organizations. More than 20 years ago, we created a process that lets organizations deliver software better. Since then, we have helped hundreds of organizations do the same. Our work has spread further than we have ever imagined possible, being put to use by millions of people. We are humbled by the extent of its adoption, and we are awed by the feats people have accomplished using it. This is not the first book we have written on the topic of building software. It is, however, the first book we have written for people who do not themselves build software. This book is instead for leaders within organizations that depend on software for their survival and competitiveness. It is for leaders within organizations that can benefit from developing software rapidly, inerementally. and with the best return on investment possible. It is for leaders who face business and technological complexity that has made the delivery of software difficult. We have written this book so that these leaders can help their organizations achieve these goals, enhance their internal capabilities, improve their product offerings, and more. This book is for chief executive officers (CEOs), executives, and senior managers who need their organizations to deliver better software in less time, with lower cost, greater predictability, and lower risk. For this audience, we have a message: You may have had negative experiences with software devel- opment in the past, but the industry has turned a corner. The software profes- sion has radically improved its methods and its results. The uncertainty, risk, and waste to which you are accustomed are no longer par for the course. We have worked with many software organizations that have already turned the corner; we want to help you do so, too. In this book, we show you how to create business value using a process that delivers complete pieces of software functionality at least every 30 days. This book will show you how you can prioritize the functionality you want and have it delivered ÔøΩ la carte. It will show you how to gain transparency not only into business value, by tracking functionality delivered against functionality desired, but also into the health of the software development process and your organization as a whole. The tools in this book will help you work with your software organization to get up to speed with modern practices and begin to deliver the results you've been expecting all along. This is software in 30 days."

Gaming Culture at the Boundaries of Play	As the field of game studies and research has matured, multiple valid, yet somewhat differently oriented approaches to games, play and players have emerged. One of them is the cultural study of games and play related phenomena. Both the British and American traditions of cultural studies have been particularly interested in advancing our understanding of popular culture by tracing its position and significance from perspectives opened up by politics, economics, sociology, as well as by literary or textual studies, to mention just a few elements from this highly interdisciplinary field. Where the hallmark of British cultural studies used to be reliance on some version of Marxism or left-wing critique of capitalist society and its cultural industries, and the American approach to cultural studies was more likely to develop liberalist analyses of empowered audiences, or fandom activities, this divide does not stand out so clearly these days. While approaching Cheating by Mia Consalvo, it is nevertheless useful to be keep in mind such intellectual traditions and debates.

Engineering emergence: applied theory for game design	Dit proefschrift presenteert twee theoretische kaders voor het ontwerpen van games en beschrijft hoe game designers deze kunnen inzetten om het game ontwerpproces te stroomlijnen. Er bestaan op dit moment meerdere ontwerptheorieÔøΩen voor games, maar geen enkele kan rekenen op een breed draagvlak binnen de game industrie. Vooral academische ontwerptheorieÔøΩen hebben regelmatig een slechte reputatie. Het eerste kader dat game designers inzicht biedt in spelregels en hun werking heet Machinations en maakt gebruik van dynamische, interactieve diagrammen. Het tweede theoretische kader van dit proefschrift, Mission/Space, richt zich op level-ontwerp en spelmechanismen die de voortgang van een speler bepalen. In tegenstelling tot bestaande modellen voor level-ontwerp, bouwt Mission/Space voort op het idee dat er in een level twee verschillende structuren bestaan. Mission-diagrammen worden gebruikt om de structuur van taken en uitdagingen voor de speler te formaliseren, terwijl space-diagrammen de ruimtelijke constructie formaliseren. Beide constructies zijn aan elkaar gerelateerd, maar zijn niet hetzelfde. De verschillende wijzen waarop missies geprojecteerd kunnen worden op een bepaalde ruimte speelt uiteindelijk een belangrijke rol in de totstandkoming van de spelervaring.

The Free Lunch Is Over: A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software	"Your free lunch will soon be over. What can you do about it? What are you doing about it? The major processor manufacturers and architectures, from Intel and AMD to Sparc and PowerPC, have run out of room with most of their traditional approaches to boosting CPU performance. Instead of driving clock speeds and straight-line instruction throughput ever higher, they are instead turning en masse to hyperthreading and multicore architectures. Both of these features are already available on chips today; in particular, multicore is available on current PowerPC and Sparc IV processors, and is coming in 2005 from Intel and AMD. Indeed, the big theme of the 2004 In-Stat/MDR Fall Processor Forum was multicore devices, as many companies showed new or updated multicore processors. Looking back, itÔøΩs not much of a stretch to call 2004 the year of multicore. And that puts us at a fundamental turning point in software development, at least for the next few years and for applications targeting general-purpose desktop computers and low-end servers (which happens to account for the vast bulk of the dollar value of software sold today). In this article, IÔøΩll describe the changing face of hardware, why it suddenly does matter to software, and how specifically the concurrency revolution matters to you and is going to change the way you will likely be writing software in the future. Arguably, the free lunch has already been over for a year or two, only weÔøΩre just now noticing."

Methods for Game User Research Studying Player Behavior to Enhance Game Design	The emerging field of game user research (GUR) investigates interaction between players and games and the surrounding context of play. Game user researchers have explored methods from, for example, human-computer interaction, psychology, interaction design, media studies, and the social sciences. They've extended and modified these methods for different types of digital games, such as social games, casual games, and serious games. This article describes several current GUR methods. A case study illustrates two specific methods: think-aloud and heuristics.

Write-once,transpile-everywhere:Re-usingmotioncontrollersofvirtualhumansacrossmultiplegameengines|Signedin	Transpilation allows to write code once and re-use it across multiple runtime environments. In this paper, we propose a software development practice to implement once the motion controllers of virtual humans and re-use the implementation in multiple game engines. In a case study, three common human behaviors ñ blinking, text-to-speech, and eye-gaze ñ were developed in the Haxe programming language and deployed in the free, open-source Blender Game Engine and the commercial Unity engine. Performance tests show that transpiled code executes within 67% faster to 127% slower with respect to an implementation manually written in the game engine target languages.

Scott and the logs: design and data capture in a preparatory online package for children undergoing GA for dental procedures	This National Institute of Health Research project aims to test if children scheduled for anaesthesia benefit from an interactive online package. The project deals with the design and data capture (logs) of a prototype (alpha) online interactive cartoon created to answer the research question: ìWill internet delivered information help children cope better with anaesthesia?î Following modification of the alpha package the resultant beta package will be compared to two control groups: standard care procedures and a non-medical computer game. An international academic audience provided positive feedback on the package design and data capture. The animation package sets an example of good practice in design for other similar healthcare scenarios.

Encore: Atari's Second System A design story	In 1975, Fredrick Brooks wrote an amazing book, The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering [1]. The book applies to managing engineering, not just software. Brooks got his experience the hard way: he managed the development of IBM?s OS/360. At that time in history, in the mid-1960s, it was the largest software project ever attempted. In the 1990s, I worked on several versions of Microsoft Windows, which were even larger. Brooks? writing was directly applicable.

Rubber Ball to Cloud Rehabilitation(c) Musing on the Future of Therapy	Summary form only. We can trace the origins of virtual rehabilitation to the late 80s when sensing gloves were used to determine the degree of hand tremor in patients with Parkinson, and virtual environments were investigated as a medium to train wheelchair navigation. At the first Medicine Meets Virtual Reality conference in San Diego in 1992, we proposed a unified system where sensing gloves were used to diagnose and train patients post hand surgery. Other researchers pioneered the use of virtual environments in phobias, attention deficit, post-traumatic stress and other conditions. In 1996 researchers interested primarily in VR phobia treatment started the CyberTherapy conference series, and VR-based physical therapy, occupational therapy, therapy for learning deficits, and amnesia were reported at the first International Conference on Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated Technologies. By 1997 the National Science Foundation funded a study of rehabilitation at a distance between Rutgers and Stanford universities, located on either side of the United States. These beginnings used color-coded virtual rubber balls and haptic gloves to program the mechanical work done by the patient's affected hand. An artificial separation existed in the clinical practice between physical or occupational rehabilitation and cognitive therapy, due in part to separate education tracks. Nonetheless virtual reality researchers realized that the same hardware could be used in either physical or cognitive rehabilitation, and all that needed changing was the simulation software used. We thus coined the term ldquovirtual rehabilitationrdquo to encompass the continuum of therapy. In 2002 the associated conference started in Switzerland as the International Workshop on Virtual Rehabilitation. This later became the Virtual Rehabilitation International Conference series which you are attending today. While ldquovirtual rehabilitationrdquo was initially met with some skepticism by therapists who were concerned patients will misunderstand it, nowadays the term is better understood. To help further recognition for this emerging field, a new society was formed in 2008, the International Society for Virtual Rehabilitation (www.isvr.org), which is a co-sponsor of this conference. The merging of physical/occupational therapy and cognitive therapy is not due solely to the modularity offered by the hardware and software used in virtual environments. Another cause is the fact that patients affected by certain neurologic and motor deficits often have psychological and other cognitive co-morbidities. A well known example is depression associated with some types of stroke or with societal isolation that often follows the inability to have regular employment. The same tele-rehabilitation systems that are projected for large scale use to train patients in their home, may also be used to reduce the sense of isolation. Video games that are now being investigated as a way to reinvigorate therapeutic interventions could also be used in future game ldquotournamentsrdquo among teams of people with disabilities, or among people with disabilities and their families and friends. Virtual environments could then be used to customize the games and allow a patient to succeed, greatly boosting morale. An extreme example is the use of virtual hand avatars controlled by people with amputated arms, an application which we pioneered back in 2003. Popular awareness of and demand for virtual rehabilitation is expected to grow, which in turn will trigger changes in the way therapists are educated and accredited. A new field of study will emerge, as will the way therapists and psychologists will be recertified. Certainly the way licensing, insurance, even liability clauses follow local geography is archaic, and a more global certification program is expected to emerge. The one-to-one paradigm of therapy will also change, with one therapist performing ldquomultiplexedrdquo tele-rehabilitation. This is expected to reduce treatment costs while also increasing access to therapeutic care worldwide. Certain technologies will need to advance to act as force multipliers and to help therapists handle the expected workload increase. One supporting technology will be home-based robots which will not only clean, cook and guard, but extend their use to provision of therapy, especially physical therapy. Advances in technology will provide the ability to take therapy anywhere, anytime, addressing current limitation due to geographical location, lack of transportation, limited therapist availability or endurance. This will be facilitated by the proliferation of portable computing/communication terminals coupled to powerful mega-servers, in what is called today ldquocloud computing.rdquo We predict that cloud computing will be extended to ldquocloud rehabilitationrdquo by transforming these portable devices into rehabilitation systems. In cloud rehabilitation the library of disability-specific software simulations or games will reside on a third-party ldquocloudrdquo of web servers. This is where clinicians will log on to set up rehabilitation regimens, follow up patient progress, insure compliance and monitor safety. By concentrating software maintenance and licensing to a unified web structure, the current information technology problems that plague healthcare institutions will be alleviated, the portability of medical data improved and the defense against unauthorized access to medical data boosted. The way to cloud rehabilitation seems straightforward - new types of input devices to measure the patient's input, games that allow clinically meaningful variables to be stored and therapeutic regimens set and monitored, distributed databases storing medical data securely, reliable and encoded communication, and of course, more computer savvy patient and therapist populations.

Whack-a-Meltdown: Microarchitectural Security Games	In early 2018, the disclosure of Spectre and Meltdown exposed the security risks inherent in speculative and out-of-order execution, which were hitherto considered harmless and valuable performance optimizations. In a nutshell, these attacks demonstrated that transient execution, where the computer executes code speculatively before reverting execution, leaves side effects on the microarchitecture, allowing adversaries to retrieve data across software- and hardware-enforced security boundaries.

Do Improve Typing Skill But No Significant Difference between Drill-Based and Game-Based Typing Software	"Improving typing skill can help students use computers to deal with different kinds of tasks more efficiently. In the past, typing software was commonly used to train studentsí typing skill, and they usually didnít have much attractive multimedia effect. In recent years, games have become more and more popular, and one of the reasons is that games have lots of attractive elements, like lots of multimedia effect and interesting scripts. About the educational effect of typing games, game is more interesting than traditional instruction, and thatís the reason why people use typing games to train their typing skill. This study tried to realize the effect on typing skill of drill-based and game-based typing software, and proposed possible design direction for typing software.

There were 160 second year junior high school students participating in this study. The students studied in a junior high school in middle Taiwan, and they came from five different classes. After excluding six invalid samples, 82 students were males (53.2%) and 72 students were females (46.8%). Pretest-posttest control group design was used in this study. The independent variable was different types of typing software. There were 92 students in the control group, and they used drill-based typing software to learn typing. There were 62 students in the experimental group, and they used game-based typing software to learn typing. The dependent variable was typing speed. The difference of typing speed between pre-test and post-test and the effect on typing speed of different software would be compared.

The result showed that both kinds of typing software could improve studentsí typing speed, but the effect on typing speed between the two kinds of software didnít reach significant difference. The result indicated that both entertainment and learning design direction were beneficial for learning typing skill, but different kinds of design also showed different disadvantages and limitations. Therefore, it is better to consider the two aspects at the same time when design edutainment software, and try to keep the balance between the two elements to produce the optimal learning effect. The future studies may confirm if the learning effect from both learning element and entertainment element is better than the learning effect only from learning element or entertainment element."
