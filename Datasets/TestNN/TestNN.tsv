0	TestNN	A framework for testing robust autonomy of UAS during design and certification	As the number of Uninhabited Airborne Systems (UAS) proliferates in civil applications, industry is increasingly putting pressure on regulation authorities to provide a path for certification and allow UAS integration into regulated airspace. The success of this integration depends on developments in improved UAS reliability and safety, regulations for certification, and technologies for operational performance and safety assessment. This paper focusses on the last topic and describes a framework for quantifying robust autonomy of UAS, which quantifies the system's ability to either continue operating in the presence of faults or safely shut down. Two figures of merit are used to evaluate vehicle performance relative to mission requirements and the consequences of autonomous decision making in motion control and guidance systems. These figures of merit are interpreted within a probabilistic framework, which extends previous work in the literature. The valuation of the figures of merit can be done using stochastic simulation scenarios during both vehicle development and certification stages with different degrees of integration of hardware-in-the-loop simulation technology. The objective of the proposed framework is to aid in decision making about the suitability of a vehicle with respect to safety and reliability relative to mission requirements.

1	TestNN	A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH TO COLLISION RISK ESTIMATION FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES	Active safety and collision avoidance (CA) is a growing field within the automotive industry. The aim of CA systems is to prevent or mitigate collisions by active interventions i.e. warning, braking and steering. For many reasons, such as driver acceptance of the system and legal requirement that the system itself must not cause hazards, the decision making is a crucial part of the system. This paper presents a method for risk estimation on which to base the decision making. We will show how one can form criterions for decision making in terms of probability of collision. This criterion handles the noisy sensor data and process noise (driver behavior) in a natural way, using existing tracking theory. The method is illustrated by simulation results as well as test result from a prototype vehicle.

2	TestNN	A rational agent controlling an autonomous vehicle: Implementation and formal verification	The development and deployment of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on our roads is not only realistic in the near future but can also bring significant benefits. In particular, it can potentially solve several problems relating to vehicles and traffic, for instance: (i) possible reduction of traffic congestion, with the consequence of improved fuel economy and reduced driver inactivity; (ii) possible reduction in the number of accidents, assuming that an AV can minimise the human errors that often cause traffic accidents; and (iii) increased ease of parking, especially when one considers the potential for shared AVs. In order to deploy an AV there are significant steps that must be completed in terms of hardware and software. As expected, software components play a key role in the complex AV system and so, at least for safety, we should assess the correctness of these components. In this paper, we are concerned with the high-level software component(s) responsible for the decisions in an AV. We intend to model an AV capable of navigation; obstacle avoidance; obstacle selection (when a crash is unavoidable) and vehicle recovery, etc, using a rational agent. To achieve this, we have established the following stages. First, the agent plans and actions have been implemented within the GWENDOLEN agent programming language. Second, we have built a simulated automotive environment in the Java language. Third, we have formally specified some of the required agent properties through LTL formulae, which are then formally verified with the AJPF verification tool. Finally, within the MCAPL framework (which comprises all the tools used in previous stages) we have obtained formal verification of our AV agent in terms of its specific behaviours. For example, the agent plans responsible for selecting an obstacle with low potential damage, instead of a higher damage obstacle (when possible) can be formally verified within MCAPL.We must emphasise that the major goal (of our present approach) lies in the formal verification of agent plans, rather than evaluating real-world applications. For this reason we utilised a simple matrix representation concerning the environment used by our agent.

4	TestNN	Accurate neuron resilience prediction for a flexible reliability management in neural network accelerators	Deep neural networks have become a ubiquitous tool for mastering complex classification tasks. Current research focuses on the development of power-efficient and fast neural network hardware accelerators for mobile and embedded devices. However, when used in safety-critical applications, for example autonomously operating vehicles, the reliability of such accelerators becomes a further optimization criterion which can stand in contrast to power-efficiency and latency. Furthermore, ensuring hardware reliability becomes increasingly challenging for shrinking structure widths and rising power densities in the nanometer semiconductor technology era. One solution to this challenge is the exploitation of fault tolerant parts in deep neural networks. In this paper we propose a new method for predicting the error resilience of neurons in deep neural networks and show that this method significantly improves upon existing methods in terms of accuracy as well as interpretability. We evaluate prediction accuracy by simulating hardware faults in networks trained on the CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC image classification benchmarks and protecting neurons according to the resilience estimations. In addition, we demonstrate how our resilience prediction can be used for a flexible trade-off between reliability and efficiency in neural network hardware accelerators.

Current research focuses on the development of power-efficient and fast neural network hardware accelerators for mobile and embedded devices. However, when used in safety-critical applications, for example autonomously operating vehicles, the reliability of such accelerators becomes a further optimization criterion which can stand in contrast to power-efficiency and latency. Furthermore, ensuring hardware reliability becomes increasingly challenging for shrinking structure widths and rising power densities in the nanometer semiconductor technology era. One solution to this challenge is the exploitation of fault tolerant parts in deep neural networks. In this paper we propose a new method for predicting the error resilience of neurons in deep neural networks and show that this method significantly improves upon existing methods in terms of accuracy as well as interpretability. We evaluate prediction accuracy by simulating hardware faults in networks trained on the CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC image classification benchmarks and protecting neurons according to the resilience estimations. In addition, we demonstrate how our resilience prediction can be used for a flexible trade-off between reliability and efficiency in neural network hardware accelerators. (c) 2018 EDAA."",

5	TestNN	Adversarial attacks on computer vision algorithms using natural perturbations	Verifying the correctness of intelligent embedded systems is notoriously difficult due to the use of machine learning algorithms that cannot provide guarantees of deterministic correctness. In this paper, our validation efforts demonstrate that the OpenCV Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) implementation for human detection is susceptible to errors due to both malicious perturbations and naturally occurring fog phenomena. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly employ a natural perturbation (like fog) as an adversarial attack using methods from computer graphics. Our experimental results show that computer vision algorithms are susceptible to errors under a small set of naturally occurring perturbations even if they are robust to a majority of such perturbations. Our methods and results may be of interest to the designers, developers and validation teams of intelligent cyber-physical systems such as autonomous cars.

6	TestNN	Analysis of the Random Direction Mobility Model with a Sense-and-Avoid Protocol	Random mobility models (RMMs) capture the random movement patterns of mobile agents, and have been widely used in the evaluation and design of mobile networks. Existing RMMs (e.g. random walk and random direction) assume every mobile agent to move independently. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs), on the other hand, need to maintain a separation distance for the safety of the airspace, and hence their mobility patterns violate the independent movement assumption of existing RMMs. In this paper, for the first time in the literature per knowledge of authors, we enhance the Random Direction RMM through equipping it with a commonly used decentralized sense and avoid protocol-- sense-and-stop (S&S). We provide analytical results on critical networking statistics such as stationary node distribution and inter-vehicle distance distribution in a two-dimensional (2-D) space using the Markov type of analysis. The analysis and simulation studies lead to interesting insights such as that the commonly used S&S protocol is not effective when the randomness of UAV mobility is high, as it increases the probability for a UAS to stay within the collision distance.

8	TestNN	Autonomous intelligent cruise control using both front and back information for tight vehicle following maneuvers	For manual driving, human drivers always look both ahead and behind to make the proper decision for assuring driving safety. It is the purpose of this paper to design an autonomous intelligent cruise control (AICC) which mimics this human driving behavior. The proposed AICC law uses information not only from the immediate predecessor but also from the immediate follower to make the proper control decision. Constant time headway safety policy is used in the design and analysis of AICC law. The individual vehicle stability, and platoon stability in both directions (backward and forward) are guaranteed by the proposed AICC law. In addition, the proposed controller can also be used to operate vehicles with constant spacing safety policy in a platoon. The platoon stability is achieved by the proposed controller (which uses only information from the immediate predecessor and follower) without any preview information from the platoon leader.

9	TestNN	Automated Information Aggregation for Scaling Scale-Resistant Services	"Machine learning provides techniques to monitor system behavior and predict failures from sensor data. However, such algorithms are ""scale resistant"" $high computational complexity and not parallelizable. The problem then becomes identifying and delivering the relevant subset of the vast amount of sensor data to each monitoring node, despite the lack of explicit ""relevance"" labels.

11	TestNN	Capturing safety requirements to enable effective task allocation between humans and automaton in increasingly autonomous systems	There is a current drive towards enabling the deployment of increasingly autonomous systems in the National Airspace System (NAS). However, shifting the traditional roles and responsibilities between humans and automation for safety critical tasks must be managed carefully, otherwise the current emergent safety properties of the NAS may be disrupted. In this paper, a verification activity to assess the emergent safety properties of a clearly defined, safety critical, operational scenario that possesses tasks that can be fluidly allocated between human and automated agents is conducted. Task allocation role sets were proposed for a human-automation team performing a contingency maneuver in a reduced crew context. A safety critical contingency procedure (engine out on takeoff) was modeled in the Soar cognitive architecture, then translated into the Hybrid Input Output formalism. Verification activities were then performed to determine whether or not the safety properties held over the increasingly autonomous system. The verification activities lead to the development of several key insights regarding the implicit assumptions on agent capability. It subsequently illustrated the usefulness of task annotations associated with specialized requirements (e.g., communication, timing etc.), and demonstrated the feasibility of this approach.

13	TestNN	Computer-aided design for safe autonomous vehicles	This paper details the design of an autonomous vehicle CAD toolchain, which captures formal descriptions of driving scenarios in order to develop a safety case for an autonomous vehicle (AV). Rather than focus on a particular component of the AV, like adaptive cruise control, the toolchain models the end-to-end dynamics of the AV in a formal way suitable for testing and verification. First, a domain-specific language capable of describing the scenarios that occur in the day-to-day operation of an AV is defined. The language allows the description and composition of traffic participants (e.g., other vehicles and traffic control devices), and the specification of formal correctness requirements. A scenario described in this language is an executable that can be processed by a specification-guided automated test generator (bug hunting), and by an exhaustive reachability tool. The toolchain allows the user to exploit and integrate the strengths of both testing and reachability, in a way not possible when each is run alone. Finally, given a particular execution of the scenario that violates the requirements, a visualization tool can display this counter-example and generate labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on three autonomous driving scenarios drawn from a collection of 36 scenarios that account for over 95% of accidents nationwide. These case studies demonstrate robustness-guided verification heuristics to reduce analysis time, counterexample visualization for identifying controller bugs in both the discrete decision logic and low-level analog (continuous) dynamics, and identification of modeling errors (e.g., traffic behaviors) that lead to unrealistic environment behavior.

14	TestNN	Convoy active safety technologies Warfighter Experiment I	The operational ability to project and sustain forces in distant, anti-access and area denial environments poses new challenges for combatant commanders. One of the new challenges is the ability to conduct sustainment operations at operationally feasible times and places on the battlefield. Combatant commanders require a sustainment system that is agile, versatile, and survivable throughout the range of military operations and across the spectrum of conflict. A key component of conducting responsive, operationally feasible sustainment operations is the ability to conduct sustainment convoys. Sustainment convoys are critical to providing combatant commanders the right support, at the right time and place, and in the right quantities, across the full range of military operations. The ability to conduct sustainment convoys in a variety of hostile environments require force protection measures that address the enemy threat and protect the Soldier. One cost effective, technically feasible method of increasing the force protection for sustainment convoys is the use of robotic follower technology and autonomous navigation. The Convoy Active Safety Technologies (CAST) system is a driver assist, convoy autopilot technology aimed to address these issues. Warfigher Experiment I, held at A.P. Hill, VA in the fall of 2007, tested the utility of this vehicle following technology not only in measures of system integrity and performance vs. manual driving, but also the physiological effects on the operators themselves.

    abstract = ""The operational ability to project and sustain forces in distant, anti-access and area denial environments poses new challenges for combatant commanders. One of the new challenges is the ability to conduct sustainment operations at operationally feasible times and places on the battlefield. Combatant commanders require a sustainment system that is agile, versatile, and survivable throughout the range of military operations and across the spectrum of conflict. A key component of conducting responsive, operationally feasible sustainment operations is the ability to conduct sustainment convoys. Sustainment convoys are critical to providing combatant commanders the right support, at the right time and place, and in the right quantities, across the full range of military operations. The ability to conduct sustainment convoys in a variety of hostile environments require force protection measures that address the enemy threat and protect the Soldier. One cost effective, technically feasible method of increasing the force protection for sustainment convoys is the use of robotic follower technology and autonomous navigation. The Convoy Active Safety Technologies (CAST) system is a driver assist, convoy autopilot technology aimed to address these issues. Warfigher Experiment I, held at A.P. Hill, VA in the fall of 2007, tested the utility of this vehicle following technology not only in measures of system integrity and performance vs. manual driving, but also the physiological effects on the operators themselves. This paper will detail the Warfigher Experiment's methodology, analysis, results and conclusions."",

15	TestNN	Deepxplore: Automated whitebox testing of deep learning systems	Deep learning (DL) systems are increasingly deployed in safety- and security-critical domains such as self-driving cars and malware detection, where the correctness and predictability of a system's behavior for corner case inputs are of great importance. Existing DL testing depends heavily on manually labeled data and therefore often fails to expose erroneous behaviors for rare inputs. We design, implement, and evaluate DeepXplore, the first white-box framework for systematically testing real-world DL systems. First, we introduce neuron coverage for measuring the parts of a DL system exercised by test inputs. Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking. Finally, we demonstrate how finding inputs for DL systems that both trigger many differential behaviors and achieve high neuron coverage can be represented as a joint optimization problem and solved efficiently using gradient-based search techniques. DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors (e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software) in state-of-the-art DL models with thousands of neurons trained on five popular datasets such as ImageNet and Udacity self-driving challenge data. For all tested DL models, on average, DeepXplore generated one test input demonstrating incorrect behavior within one second while running only on a commodity laptop. We further show that the test inputs generated by DeepXplore can also be used to retrain the corresponding DL model to improve the model's accuracy by up to 3%.

16	TestNN	Evaluation and Mitigation of Soft-Errors in Neural Network-Based Object Detection in Three GPU Architectures	In this paper, we evaluate the reliability of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection framework. We have exposed to controlled neutron beams GPUs designed with three different architectures (Kepler, Maxwell, and Pascal) running Darknet, a Convolutional Neural Network for automotive applications, detecting objects in both Caltech and Visual Object Classes data sets. By analyzing the neural network corrupted output, we can distinguish between tolerable errors and critical errors, i.e., errors that could impact on real-time system execution.Additionally, we propose an Algorithm-Based Fault-Tolerance (ABFT) strategy to apply to the matrix multiplication kernels of neural networks able to detect and correct 50% to 60% of radiation induced corruptions. We experimentally validate our hardening solution and compare its efficiency and efficacy with the available ECC.

17	TestNN	Evaluation of drivers authority in a structured set of driving tasks and decisions: Preliminary results on vehicle simulator study	One of the most challenging factors in the development of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems is the imitation of an expert driver system which is the observer and interpreter of the technical system in the related driving scenario. To achieve an expert human-like situational understanding and decision making may be an important feature to fulfill the necessary active safety requirements. In this paper, an exploratory study on a multimodal adaptive driver assistance system is presented. The main goal is to determine the human driver's attention and authority level in a cognitive model and to trigger the timely warnings according to his/her driving intents and driving skills with respect to the possible driving situation and hazard scenarios. In the previous studies, a fairly restrictive vision-based driver assistance system has been deployed to detect lane departure, blind-spot and to monitor following distance, headway time. This vision-based driver assistance system considers the driver's driving performance metric sampled during the longitudinal and lateral vehicle control tasks as well as the processed information about the surrounding traffic environment consisting of the interactions with the other vehicles and the road situations. The presented active safety system models the driving task in a cognitive architecture and assesses the cognition of the human driver by modeling the situation awareness of the driver by using fuzzy sets. Each fuzzy set simply represents the expert driver's perception in both of the longitudinal and lateral traffic. The presented system evaluates the driver's driving skills and attention level by comparing the expert and human driver's reactions suited in a finite set of decision and maneuvering task. In case of hazard analysis, the system triggers timely warnings pointing the driver's attention at the lateral or longitudinal maneuvering tasks depending on the interpreted situation. Introductory experiments are performed with a limited number of participants, the test driving data including the driver's perception and reaction to the surrounding vehicles and traffic situations are collected by the use of a vehicle simulator. And the presented multimodal adaptive driver assistance system is evaluated by the simulator. The preliminary results seem to be promising.

18	TestNN	Guaranteed safe online learning via reachability: Tracking a ground target using a quadrotor	While machine learning techniques have become popular tools in the design of autonomous systems, the asymptotic nature of their performance guarantees means that they should not be used in scenarios in which safety and robustness are critical for success. By pairing machine learning algorithms with rigorous safety analyses, such as Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) reachability, this limitation can be overcome. Guaranteed Safe Online Learning via Reachability (GSOLR) is a framework which combines HJI reachability with general machine learning techniques, allowing for the design of robotic systems which demonstrate both high performance and guaranteed safety. In this paper we show how the GSOLR framework can be applied to a target tracking problem, in which an observing quadrotor helicopter must keep a target ground vehicle with unknown (but bounded) dynamics inside its field of view at all times, while simultaneously attempting to build a motion model of the target. The resulting algorithm was implemented on board the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control, and was compared to a naive safety-only algorithm and a learning-only algorithm. Experimental results illustrate the success of the GSOLR algorithm, even under scenarios in which the machine learning algorithm performed poorly (and would otherwise lead to unsafe actions), thus demonstrating the power of this technique.

19	TestNN	Integrating virtual agents to allow safe, complex testing of autonomous unmanned vehicles	DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A; APPROVAL FOR PUBLIC RELEASE DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED. A gap currently exists in the industry's ability to carry out safe, rigorous testing of autonomous unmanned vehicles (AUVs). In 2013, the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) initiated an effort to design an infrastructure for carrying out complex and safe tests of AUVs under the Safe Testing of Autonomy in Complex Environments (TACE) program. The TACE infrastructure watches over the system under test's (SUT) autonomous decisions to assure that the SUT does not violate safety constraints during a test. TACE also provides complex, interactive, stimulation to the SUT autonomy necessary to assess SUT performance. To reduce cost and help increase safety during a test, the stimulation of the autonomy must often be synthetic, such as simulating other vehicles in the same test as the SUT. Additionally, a vendor may wish to test live autonomous systems interacting with simulated cooperative systems, allowing autonomous cooperative behavior to be tested without the risk and expense of having a larger number of SUTs. This paper will detail the software written to simulate autonomous agents, including communications between live and virtual autonomous agents. TRMC's Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) was used to handle the networking layer, while the Naval Air Systems Command's (NAVAIR) Joint Integrated Mission Model (JIMM) was used to simulate the battlespace environment and maintain ground truth. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL)-developed Autonomy Tool Kit (ATK) was used as the autonomy engine driving both the live SUT and the virtual cooperative agents.

20	TestNN	Intelligent sensor attack detection and identification for automotive cyber-physical systems	This paper addresses the problem of detection and identification of the sensor attacks when most sensors are attacked. Sensors can play a key role to improve safety and convenience in automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). A dramatic increase in connectivity and openness of the automotive CPS brings high security risks. If multiple and heterogeneous sensors equipped for braking and steering provides false sensing information for their controllers under deception attacks, it might cause catastrophic situations during driving. If the existing machine learning approaches are applied for sensor attacks while the majority of sensors is attacked, it cannot guarantee to identify deceptions as cyber-physical attacks. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent sensor attack detection and identification method based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques, called deep learning, without a prior knowledge about the deception attacks modifying sensing data in time. We investigate an autonomous vehicle with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and wheel encoder sensors under conditions of uncertainty and nonlinearity during driving. We firstly identify all possible attacks category on the sensors of it, choose what model to use and then systematically design its architecture on which the performance of deep learning highly depends. We train and then validate the proposed method's performance on real measurement data obtained from an unmanned ground vehicle. Finally, we show analytically the superiority of our method in terms of accuracy, precision, and computation time, including the worst situation where two among three sensors are simultaneously attacked.

    abstract = ""This paper addresses the problem of detection and identification of the sensor attacks when most sensors are attacked. Sensors can play a key role to improve safety and convenience in automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). A dramatic increase in connectivity and openness of the automotive CPS brings high security risks. If multiple and heterogeneous sensors equipped for braking and steering provides false sensing information for their controllers under deception attacks, it might cause catastrophic situations during driving. If the existing machine learning approaches are applied for sensor attacks while the majority of sensors is attacked, it cannot guarantee to identify deceptions as cyber-physical attacks. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent sensor attack detection and identification method based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques, called deep learning, without a prior knowledge about the deception attacks modifying sensing data in time. We investigate an autonomous vehicle with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and wheel encoder sensors under conditions of uncertainty and nonlinearity during driving. We firstly identify all possible attacks category on the sensors of it, choose what model to use and then systematically design its architecture on which the performance of deep learning highly depends. We train and then validate the proposed method's performance on real measurement data obtained from an unmanned ground vehicle. Finally, we show analytically the superiority of our method in terms of accuracy, precision, and computation time, including the worst situation where two among three sensors are simultaneously attacked.

21	TestNN	Introducing ASIL inspired dynamic tactical safety decision framework for automated vehicles	Existing automotive Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) process as discussed by the international standard ISO 26262 is static in nature. While the standard describes a systematic process to incorporate functional safety in the development process of Electrical & Electronic (E/E) systems, it fails to address the needs of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) systems. In order to ensure the safety of ADAS and AD systems, it is important to incorporate the changing nature of interactions between the system and the environment, in the safety analysis process for ADAS and AD systems. In this paper, the authors argue the need for a dynamic approach for automotive safety analysis by adapting the tactical safety for ADAS and AD systems depending on the real-time operational capability and real-time ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) rating of a situation, and discuss a framework for this process. The novelty and therefore contribution of this paper lies in the proposed ASIL inspired dynamic tactical safety framework, which evaluates the severity, controllability and exposure ratings in real-time based on the real time values of the various vehicle and environment parameters. These ratings are used to assign a real-time ASIL value which is used to determine the tactical decisions in order to lower the ASIL value in real-time by altering the functional (operational) capability of the system. Furthermore, the framework is explained with the help of a case study based on a combined Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system.

23	TestNN	Is Deep Learning Safe for Robot Vision? Adversarial Examples Against the iCub Humanoid	Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in recent years, exhibiting impressive performances in several application domains. It has however been shown that they can be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., images altered by a barely-perceivable adversarial noise, carefully crafted to mislead classification. In this work, we aim to evaluate the extent to which robot-vision systems embodying deep-learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and propose a computationally efficient countermeasure to mitigate this threat, based on rejecting classification of anomalous inputs. We then provide a clearer understanding of the safety properties of deep networks through an intuitive empirical analysis, showing that the mapping learned by such networks essentially violates the smoothness assumption of learning algorithms. We finally discuss the main limitations of this work, including the creation of real-world adversarial examples, and sketch promising research directions.

    abstract = ""Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in recent years, exhibiting impressive performances in several application domains. It has however been shown that they can be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., images altered by a barely-perceivable adversarial noise, carefully crafted to mislead classification. In this work, we aim to evaluate the extent to which robot-vision systems embodying deep-learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and propose a computationally efficient countermeasure to mitigate this threat, based on rejecting classification of anomalous inputs. We then provide a clearer understanding of the safety properties of deep networks through an intuitive empirical analysis, showing that the mapping learned by such networks essentially violates the smoothness assumption of learning algorithms. We finally discuss the main limitations of this work, including the creation of real-world adversarial examples, and sketch promising research directions. (c) 2017 IEEE."",

24	TestNN	Machine learning and deep neural network - Artificial intelligence core for lab and real-world test and validation for ADAS and autonomous vehicles: AI for efficient and quality test and validation	Autonomous vehicles are now the future of automobile industry. Human drivers can be completely taken out of the loop through the implementation of safe and intelligent autonomous vehicles. Although we can say that HW and SW development continues to play a large role in the automotive industry, test and validation of these systems is a must. The ability to test these vehicles thoroughly and efficiently will ensure their proper and flawless operation. When a large number of people with heterogeneous knowledge and skills try to develop an autonomous vehicle together, it is important to use a sensible engineering process. State of the art techniques for such development include Waterfall, Agile & V-model, where test & validation (T&V) process is an integral part of such a development cycle. This paper will propose a new methodology using machine learning & deep neural network (AI-core) for lab & real-world T&V for ADAS (Advanced driver assistance system) and autonomous vehicles. The methodology will initially connect T&V of individual systems in each level of development and that of complete system efficiently, by using the proposed phase methodology, in which autonomous driving functions are grouped under categories, special T&V processes are carried on simulation as well as in HIL systems. The complete transition towards AI in the field of T&V will be a sequence of steps. Initially the AI-core is fed with available test scenarios, boundary conditions for the test cases and scenarios, and examples, the AI-core will conduct virtual tests on simulation environment using available test scenarios and further generates new test cases and scenarios for efficient and precise tests. These test cases and scenarios are meant to cover all available cases and concentrate on the area where bugs or failures occur. The complete surrounding environment in the simulation is also controlled by the AI-core which means that the system can attain endless/all-possible combinations of the surrounding environment which is necessary. Results of the tests are sorted and stored, critical and important tests are again repeated in the real-world environment using automated cars with other real subsystems to depict the surrounding environment, which are all controlled by the AI-core, and meanwhile the AI-core is always in the loop and learning from each and every executed test case and its results/outcomes. The main goal is to achieve efficient and high quality test and validation of systems for automated driving, which can save precious time in the development process. As a future scope of this methodology, we can step-up to make most parts of test and validation completely autonomous.

25	TestNN	MAR-CPS: Measurable augmented reality for prototyping Cyber-Physical systems	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) refer to engineering platforms that rely on the inte- gration of physical systems with control, computation, and communication technologies. Autonomous vehicles are instances of CPSs that are rapidly growing with applications in many domains. Due to the integration of physical systems with computational sens- ing, planning, and learning in CPSs, hardware-in-the-loop experiments are an essential step for transitioning from simulations to real-world experiments. This paper proposes an architecture for rapid prototyping of CPSs that has been developed in the Aerospace Controls Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This system, referred to as MAR-CPS (Measurable Augmented Reality for Prototyping Cyber-Physical Systems), includes physical vehicles and sensors, a motion capture technology, a projection system, and a communication network. The role of the projection system is to augment a physical laboratory space with 1) autonomous vehicles' beliefs and 2) a simulated mission environ- ment, which in turn will be measured by physical sensors on the vehicles. The main focus of this method is on rapid design of planning, perception, and learning algorithms for au- tonomous single-agent or multi-agent systems. Moreover, the proposed architecture allows researchers to project a simulated counterpart of outdoor environments in a controlled, indoor space, which can be crucial when testing in outdoor environments is disfavored due to safety, regulatory, or monetary concerns. We discuss the issues related to the design and implementation of MAR-CPS and demonstrate its real-time behavior in a variety of problems in autonomy, such as motion planning, multi-robot coordination, and learning spatio-temporal fields.

26	TestNN	Extending service model to build an effective service composition framework for cyber-physical systems	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are combinations of physical entities controlled by software systems to accomplish specified tasks under stringent real-time and physical entity constraints. As more and more physical entities are equipped with embedded computers, they are becoming more and more intelligent. However, the problem of effectively composing the services provided by cyber and physical entities to achieve specific goals still remains a challenge. Traditional service-oriented models and composition techniques are insufficient for CPS. In this paper, we present a novel Physical-Entity (PE) service-oriented model to address the problem, including the concepts of PE-ontology and PE-SOA specifications. Based on the model, we develop a two-level compositional reasoning approach, which divides the process into abstract and physical levels to expedite the composition process. With the assistance of the PE-ontology and PE-SOA, abstract level reasoning is performed by hiding the physical level details. This separation greatly reduces the search space for both levels through a divide-and-conquer technique. The model and the composition approach are illustrated using a simplified emergency response case study system.

As more and more physical entities are equipped with embedded computers, they are becoming more and more intelligent. However, the problem of effectively composing the services provided by cyber and physical entities to achieve specific goals still remains a challenge. Traditional service-oriented models and composition techniques are insufficient for CPS. In this paper, we present a novel Physical-Entity (PE) service-oriented model to address the problem, including the concepts of PE-ontology and PE-SOA specifications. Based on the model, we develop a two-level compositional reasoning approach, which divides the process into abstract and physical levels to expedite the composition process. With the assistance of the PE-ontology and PE-SOA, abstract level reasoning is performed by hiding the physical level details. This separation greatly reduces the search space for both levels through a divide-and-conquer technique. The model and the composition approach are illustrated using a simplified emergency response case study system."",

28	TestNN	Modeling risk perception for mars rover supervisory control: Before and after wheel damage	The perception of risk can dramatically influence the human selection of semi-autonomous system control strategies, particularly in safety-critical systems like unmanned vehicle operation. Thus, the ability to understand the components of risk perception can be extremely valuable in developing either operational strategies or decision support technologies. To this end, this paper analyzes the differences in human supervisory control of Mars Science Laboratory rover operation before and after the discovery of wheel damage. This paper identifies four operational factors sensitive to risk perception changes including rover distance traveled, utilization frequency of the autonomous driving capability (AutoNav), terrain risk weighting, and changes in high-level mission planning. A resulting Rover Risk Perception Model illustrates how these operational factors relate to increased perception of risk. Based on these results, we propose aiding risk perception mitigation strategies such that risk can be appropriately anchored. Such strategies can include a change in system design including adding technology and decision support tools, or changing the training of operators who use the system.

29	TestNN	On the Robustness of a Neural Network	With the development of neural networks based machine learning and their usage in mission critical applications, voices are rising against the black box aspect of neural networks as it becomes crucial to understand their limits and capabilities. With the rise of neuromorphic hardware, it is even more critical to understand how a neural network, as a distributed system, tolerates the failures of its computing nodes, neurons, and its communication channels, synapses. Experimentally assessing the robustness of neural networks involves the quixotic venture of testing all the possible failures, on all the possible inputs, which ultimately hits a combinatorial explosion for the first, and the impossibility to gather all the possible inputs for the second.In this paper, we prove an upper bound on the expected error of the output when a subset of neurons crashes. This bound involves dependencies on the network parameters that can be seen as being too pessimistic in the average case. It involves a polynomial dependency on the Lipschitz coefficient of the neurons' activation function, and an exponential dependency on the depth of the layer where a failure occurs. We back up our theoretical results with experiments illustrating the extent to which our prediction matches the dependencies between the network parameters and robustness. Our results show that the robustness of neural networks to the average crash can be estimated without the need to neither test the network on all failure configurations, nor access the training set used to train the network, both of which are practically impossible requirements.

30	TestNN	Preemptive detection of unsafe motion liable for hazard	Establishing a safety standard for autonomous vehicles operating in open and dynamic environment is a challenge. As collisions are inevitable in over-constrained situations, we focus on deciding the liability for a hazard. Our insight is that hazards caused by malfunctions of autonomous vehicles result from loss of functional integrity. Design defects may leave it unnoticed, or the real-world may make integrity- preserving motion infeasible. Guarantee of functional integrity in an observable way at run-time is indispensable for revealing defects by using formal root-cause analysis, and for supporting safety claims by dismissing unreasonable doubts about design defects. From a practitical standpoint, we attempt to formalize a verification problem that consists of a novel criterion for determining liability for hazard, a safety claim comprised of confirmed observable states, and assumptions underlying the safety claim. We propose a run-time scheme of monitoring events that may lead to violations of the assumptions and a precursor to root-causes leading to loss of functional integrity and consequent hazards. We formulate a means of preemptively detecting unsafe motions liable to be hazardous as satisfiability problem within the framework of an adversarial motion planning subject to assumptions on maneuverability of movers. A numerical study shows that the run-time scheme using non-linear programming (NLP) encoding is viable in a real-world setting.

31	TestNN	Reasoning About Risk in Agent's Deliberation Process: A Jadex Implementation	Autonomous agents and multi-agent systems have been proved to be useful in several safety-critical applications. However, in current agent architectures (particularly BDI architectures) the deliberation process does not include any form of risk analysis. In this paper, we propose guidelines to implement Tropos Goal-Risk reasoning. Our proposal aims at introducing risk reasoning in the deliberation process of a BDI agent so that the overall set of possible plans is evaluated with respect to risk. When the level of risk results too high, agents can consider and introduce additional plans, called treatments, that produce an overall reduction of the risk. Side effects of treatments are also considered as part of the model. To make the discussion more concrete, we illustrate the proposal with a case study on the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle agent.

32	TestNN	Reluplex: An efficient smt solver for verifying deep neural networks	Deep neural networks have emerged as a widely used and effective means for tackling complex, real-world problems. However, a major obstacle in applying them to safety-critical systems is the great difficulty in providing formal guarantees about their behavior. We present a novel, scalable, and efficient technique for verifying properties of deep neural networks (or providing counter-examples). The technique is based on the simplex method, extended to handle the non-convex Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is a crucial ingredient in many modern neural networks. The verification procedure tackles neural networks as a whole, without making any simplifying assumptions. We evaluated our technique on a prototype deep neural network implementation of the next-generation airborne collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). Results show that our technique can successfully prove properties of networks that are an order of magnitude larger than the largest networks verified using existing methods.

35	TestNN	Safety verification of autonomous vehicles for coordinated evasive maneuvers	The verification of evasive maneuvers for autonomous vehicles driving with constant velocity is considered. Modeling uncertainties, uncertain measurements, and disturbances can cause substantial deviations from an initially planned evasive maneuver. From this follows that the maneuver, which is safe under perfect conditions, might become unsafe. In this work, the possible set of deviations is computed with methods from reachability analysis, which allows to verify evasive maneuvers under consideration of the mentioned uncertainties. Since the presented approach has a short response time, it can be applied for real time safety decisions. The methods are presented for a numerical example where two autonomous cars plan a coordinated evasive maneuver in order to prevent a collision with a wrong-way driver.

36	TestNN	STPA-based hazard analysis of a complex UAV system in take-off	The ATRC-UAV system is a multifunction system with close subsystem component interactions. Considering its complexity, component hardware failures are no longer the only reason for flight testing accidents, and a comprehensive approach is needed for hazard analysis. Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a novel technique based on systems theory rather than traditional reliability theories. It addresses safety of complex systems as a control problem rather than a failure problem. In this paper, we adopt STPA on a subscale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system take-off hazard analysis and the potential feasibility of STPA for complex UAV system is demonstrated. Unsafe control actions during take-off and their relevant control flaws are identified and safety constrains at different levels are specified. In addition to component failures, we discover that component interactions and flawed human decision making might also lead to violation of safety constrains by using STPA.

37	TestNN	System safety surveillance and control system concept for autonomous or semi-autonomous systems fall-back layer realization	Autonomous and semi-autonomous aerial systems (AES) are often needed to perform tasks in complex and dynamic environments, especially in search and rescue applications. The safe navigation assurance as well as safety assurance of AES are open research issues. This paper investigates modeling of fallback layer for AES assurance. To realize given advanced requirement the System Safety Surveillance and Control (SSSC) system concept is introduced. To fulfill safety requirements also for software developments formal requirements are formulated, to be realized with the formal modeling technique Strictly Formalized Situation-Operator-Modeling (sf-SOM). Fall-back system integration into AES can achieve system safety by separated safety consideration and emergency behavior integration and realization. Universally concept design permits the fall-back layer realization also for other applications.

The safe navigation assurance as well as safety assurance of AES are open research issues. This paper investigates modeling of fallback layer for AES assurance. To realize given advanced requirement the System Safety Surveillance and Control (SSSC) system concept is introduced. To fulfill safety requirements also for software developments formal requirements are formulated, to be realized with the formal modeling technique Strictly Formalized Situation-Operator-Modeling (sf-SOM). Fall-back system integration into AES can achieve system safety by separated safety consideration and emergency behavior integration and realization. Universally concept design permits the fall-back layer realization also for other applications.

39	TestNN	The Robustly-Safe Automated Driving System for Enhanced Active Safety	Road safety is one of the major concerns for automated vehicles. In order for these vehicles to interact safely and efficiently with the other road participants, the behavior of the automated vehicles should be carefully designed. Liu and Tomizuka proposed the Robustly-safe Automated Driving system (ROAD) which prevents or minimizes occurrences of collisions of the automated vehicle with other road participants while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, a set of design principles are elaborated as an extension of the previous work, including robust perception and cognition algorithms for environment monitoring and high level decision making and low level control algorithms for safe maneuvering of the automated vehicle. The autonomous driving problem in mixed traffic is posed as a stochastic optimization problem, which is solved by 1) behavior classification and trajectory prediction of other road participants, and 2) a unique parallel planner architecture which addresses the efficiency goal in the long term and the safety goal in the short term separately. Moreover, a python-based high fidelity simulation system is developed and extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, where both high level decision making and low level vehicle regulation are considered. Two typical scenarios are studied, driving on freeway and driving in unstructured environments such as parking lots. In the simulation, multiple moving agents representing surrounding vehicles and pedestrians are added to the environment, some of which are controlled by human subjects in order to test the real time response of the automated vehicle.

42	TestNN	Trust Bit: Reward-based intelligent vehicle commination using blockchain paper	The Intelligent vehicle is experiencing revolutionary growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from a lot of security vulnerabilities. Traditional security methods are incapable of providing secure IV, mainly in terms of communication. In IV communication, major issues are trust and data accuracy of received and broadcasted reliable data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works for the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin which has been recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies to IV Communication world. IV to IV, communicate in a decentralized manner within communication networks. In this paper, we have proposed, Trust Bit (TB) for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology. Our proposed trust bit provides surety for each IVs broadcasted data, to be secure and reliable in every particular networks. Our Trust Bit is a symbol of trustworthiness of vehicles behavior, and vehicles legal and illegal action. Our proposal also includes a reward system, which can exchange some TB among IVs, during successful communication. For the data management of this trust bit, we have used blockchain technology in the vehicular cloud, which can store all Trust bit details and can be accessed by IV anywhere and anytime. Our proposal provides secure and reliable information. We evaluate our proposal with the help of IV communication on intersection use case which analyzes a variety of trustworthiness between IVs during communication.

    abstract = ""The Intelligent vehicle is experiencing revolutionary growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from a lot of security vulnerabilities. Traditional security methods are incapable of providing secure IV, mainly in terms of communication. In IV communication, major issues are trust and data accuracy of received and broadcasted reliable data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works for the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin which has been recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies to IV Communication world. IV to IV, communicate in a decentralized manner within communication networks. In this paper, we have proposed, Trust Bit (TB) for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology. Our proposed trust bit provides surety for each IVs broadcasted data, to be secure and reliable in every particular networks. Our Trust Bit is a symbol of trustworthiness of vehicles behavior, and vehicles legal and illegal action. Our proposal also includes a reward system, which can exchange some TB among IVs, during successful communication. For the data management of this trust bit, we have used blockchain technology in the vehicular cloud, which can store all Trust bit details and can be accessed by IV anywhere and anytime. Our proposal provides secure and reliable information. We evaluate our proposal with the help of IV communication on intersection use case which analyzes a variety of trustworthiness between IVs during communication. (c) 2018 IEEE."",

43	TestNN	Trusted machine learning: Model repair and data repair for probabilistic models	When machine learning algorithms are used in life-critical or mission-critical applications (e.g., self driving cars, cyber security, surgical robotics), it is important to ensure that they provide some high-level correctness guarantees. We introduce a paradigm called Trusted Machine Learning (TML) with the goal of making learning techniques more trustworthy. We outline methods that show how symbolic analysis (specifically parametric model checking) can be used to learn the dynamical model of a system where the learned model satisfies correctness requirements specified in the form of temporal logic properties (e.g., safety, liveness). When a learned model does not satisfy the desired guarantees, we try two approaches: (1) Model Repair, wherein we modify a learned model directly, and (2) Data Repair, wherein we modify the data so that re-learning from the modified data will result in a trusted model. Model Repair tries to make the minimal changes to the trained model while satisfying the properties, whereas Data Repair tries to make the minimal changes to the dataset used to train the model for ensuring satisfaction of the properties. We show how the Model Repair and Data Repair problems can be solved for the case of probabilistic models, specifically Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) or Markov Decision Processes (MDP), when the desired properties are expressed in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). Specifically, we outline how the parameter learning problem in the probabilistic Markov models under temporal logic constraints can be equivalently expressed as a non-linear optimization with non-linear rational constraints, by performing symbolic transformations using a parametric model checker. We illustrate the approach on two case studies: A controller for automobile lane changing, and query router for a wireless sensor network.

44	TestNN	Understanding error propagation in deep learning neural network (DNN) accelerators and applications	Deep learning neural networks (DNNs) have been successful in solving a wide range of machine learning problems. Specialized hardware accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the execution of DNN algorithms for high-performance and energy efficiency. Recently, they have been deployed in datacenters (potentially for business-critical or industrial applications) and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars. Soft errors caused by high-energy particles have been increasing in hardware systems, and these can lead to catastrophic failures in DNN systems. Traditional methods for building resilient systems, e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), are agnostic of the DNN algorithm and the DNN accelerator's architecture. Hence, these traditional resilience approaches incur high overheads, which makes them challenging to deploy. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the resilience characteristics of DNN systems (i.e., DNN software running on specialized accelerators). We find that the error resilience of a DNN system depends on the data types, values, data reuses, and types of layers in the design. Based on our observations, we propose two efficient protection techniques for DNN systems.	soft error;  silent data corruption;  reliability;  deep learning; soft error, silent data corruption, reliability, deep learning	Li, Guanpeng; Hari, Siva Kumar Sastry; Sullivan, Michael; Tsai, Timothy; Pattabiraman, Karthik; Emer, Joel; Keckler, Stephen W.

49	TestNN	A Motion Certification Concept to Evaluate Operational Safety and Optimizing Operating Parameters at Runtime	For technical systems, which perform highly automated or so-called autonomous actions, there exist a large demand to evaluate their operational safety in a uniform way at runtime based on the combination of environmental threats and the conditions of subordinated system modules. To guarantee a safe motion based on autonomous decisions we have introduced a universal and transparent certification process which not only takes functional aspects like environment detection and collision avoidance techniques into account but especially identifies the associated system condition itself as a key aspect for the determination of operational safety and for an automated optimization of operating parameters. Similar to a feedback loop possible constraints for environment perception of sensor components or the ability of actuator components to interact with their environment have to be taken into account to introduce a generalized safetyevaluation for the entire system. Therefore, a model is derived to evaluate the operational safety for the autonomous driving robot RAVON from TU Kaiserslautern based on an integrated behavior-based control (IB2C).

50	TestNN	Advances in Vision-Based Lane Detection: Algorithms, Integration, Assessment, and Perspectives on ACP-Based Parallel Vision	Lane detection is a fundamental aspect of most current advanced driver assistance systems U+0028 ADASs U+0029. A large number of existing results focus on the study of vision-based lane detection methods due to the extensive knowledge background and the low-cost of camera devices. In this paper, previous vision-based lane detection studies are reviewed in terms of three aspects, which are lane detection algorithms, integration, and evaluation methods. Next, considering the inevitable limitations that exist in the camera-based lane detection system, the system integration methodologies for constructing more robust detection systems are reviewed and analyzed. The integration methods are further divided into three levels, namely, algorithm, system, and sensor. Algorithm level combines different lane detection algorithms while system level integrates other object detection systems to comprehensively detect lane positions. Sensor level uses multi-modal sensors to build a robust lane recognition system. In view of the complexity of evaluating the detection system, and the lack of common evaluation procedure and uniform metrics in past studies, the existing evaluation methods and metrics are analyzed and classified to propose a better evaluation of the lane detection system. Next, a comparison of representative studies is performed. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of current lane detection systems and the future developing trends toward an Artificial Society, Computational experiment-based parallel lane detection framework is proposed.

51	TestNN	An efficient phased mission reliability analysis for autonomous vehicles	Autonomous systems are becoming more commonly used, especially in hazardous situations. Such systems are expected to make their own decisions about future actions when some capabilities degrade due to failures of their subsystems. Such decisions are made without human input, therefore they need to be well-informed in a short time when the situation is analysed and future consequences of the failure are estimated. The future planning of the mission should take account of the likelihood of mission failure. The reliability analysis for autonomous systems can be performed using the methodologies developed for phased mission analysis, where the causes of failure for each phase in the mission can be expressed by fault trees. Unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) are of a particular interest in the aeronautical industry, where it is a long term ambition to operate them routinely in civil airspace. Safety is the main requirement for the UAV operation and the calculation of failure probability of each phase and the overall mission is the topic of this paper. When components or subsystems fail or environmental conditions throughout the mission change, these changes can affect the future mission. The new proposed methodology takes into account the available diagnostics data and is used to predict future capabilities of the UAV in real time. Since this methodology is based on the efficient BDD method, the quickly provided advice can be used in making decisions. When failures occur appropriate actions are required in order to preserve safety of the autonomous vehicle. The overall decision making strategy for autonomous vehicles is explained in this paper. Some limitations of the methodology are discussed and further improvements are presented based on experimental results.

52	TestNN	Autonomous cognition and recovery controller design of UAV spiral	Aiming at dealing with the spiral recovery puzzle of aerial vehicles, we put forward an autonomous spiral cognition and recovery control method of the unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV). First of all, the safety control framework of unmanned aerial vehicles(UAV) based on flight state-cognition is built and the autonomous spiral cognition and recovery controller is designed. Then, the spiral factors are analyzed and the spiral state is recognized by using intuitive fuzzy statistic adjudging and decision-making algorithm according to timing flight variables information afforded by airborne sensors. Finally, the control scheduling of state variables is considered, and nonlinear dynamic inversion control laws are designed, which accomplish the guidance and control of the UAV spiral. Simulation results and their analysis suggest that, compared with the existing strategies, the proposed control method can decrease the time needed for spiral recovery evidently and meanwhile has good dynamic response characteristics.

53	TestNN	Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Intrusion Detection for Vehicles Using Deep Learning	Detection of cyber attacks against vehicles is of growing interest. As vehicles typically afford limited processing resources, proposed solutions are rule-based or lightweight machine learning techniques. We argue that this limitation can be lifted with computational offloading commonly used for resource-constrained mobile devices. The increased processing resources available in this manner allow access to more advanced techniques. Using as case study a small four-wheel robotic land vehicle, we demonstrate the practicality and benefits of offloading the continuous task of intrusion detection that is based on deep learning. This approach achieves high accuracy much more consistently than with standard machine learning techniques and is not limited to a single type of attack or the in-vehicle CAN bus as previous work. As input, it uses data captured in real-time that relate to both cyber and physical processes, which it feeds as time series data to a neural network architecture. We use both a deep multilayer perceptron and recurrent neural network architecture, with the latter benefitting from a long-short term memory hidden layer, which proves very useful for learning the temporal context of different attacks. We employ denial of service, command injection and malware as examples of cyber attacks that are meaningful for a robotic vehicle. The practicality of computation offloading depends on the resources afforded onboard and remotely, and the reliability of the communication means between them.

    abstract = ""Detection of cyber attacks against vehicles is of growing interest. As vehicles typically afford limited processing resources, proposed solutions are rule-based or lightweight machine learning techniques. We argue that this limitation can be lifted with computational offloading commonly used for resource-constrained mobile devices. The increased processing resources available in this manner allow access to more advanced techniques. Using as case study a small four-wheel robotic land vehicle, we demonstrate the practicality and benefits of offloading the continuous task of intrusion detection that is based on deep learning. This approach achieves high accuracy much more consistently than with standard machine learning techniques and is not limited to a single type of attack or the in-vehicle CAN bus as previous work. As input, it uses data captured in real-time that relate to both cyber and physical processes, which it feeds as time series data to a neural network architecture. We use both a deep multilayer perceptron and recurrent neural network architecture, with the latter benefitting from a long-short term memory hidden layer, which proves very useful for learning the temporal context of different attacks. We employ denial of service, command injection and malware as examples of cyber attacks that are meaningful for a robotic vehicle. The practicality of computation offloading depends on the resources afforded onboard and remotely, and the reliability of the communication means between them. Using detection latency as the criterion, we have developed a mathematical model to determine when computation offloading is beneficial given parameters related to the operation of the network and the processing demands of the deep learning model.

54	TestNN	DeepTest: Automated testing of deep-neural-network-driven autonomous cars	Recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have led to the development of DNN-driven autonomous cars that, using sensors like camera, LiDAR, etc., can drive without any human intervention. Most major manufacturers including Tesla, GM, Ford, BMW, and Waymo/Google are working on building and testing different types of autonomous vehicles. The lawmakers of several US states including California, Texas, and New York have passed new legislation to fast-track the process of testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on their roads. However, despite their spectacular progress, DNNs, just like traditional software, often demonstrate incorrect or unexpected corner-case behaviors that can lead to potentially fatal collisions. Several such real-world accidents involving autonomous cars have already happened including one which resulted in a fatality. Most existing testing techniques for DNN-driven vehicles are heavily dependent on the manual collection of test data under different driving conditions which become prohibitively expensive as the number of test conditions increases. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic testing tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors of DNN-driven vehicles that can potentially lead to fatal crashes. First, our tool is designed to automatically generated test cases leveraging real-world changes in driving conditions like rain, fog, lighting conditions, etc. DeepTest systematically explore different parts of the DNN logic by generating test inputs that maximize the numbers of activated neurons. DeepTest found thousands of erroneous behaviors under different realistic driving conditions (e.g., blurring, rain, fog, etc.) many of which lead to potentially fatal crashes in three top performing DNNs in the Udacity self-driving car challenge.

56	TestNN	Exploring Strategies for Training Deep Neural Networks	Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms.

57	TestNN	Failing to Learn: Autonomously Identifying Perception Failures for Self-Driving Cars	One of the major open challenges in self-driving cars is the ability to detect cars and pedestrians to safely navigate in the world. Deep learning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using camera imagery to detect and classify objects. But for a safety critical application, such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current state of the art are still too high to enable safe operation. Moreover, the characterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing on prerecorded datasets. Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without additional human labels. In this letter, we propose an automated method to identify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels. We show that inconsistencies in the object detector output between a pair of similar images can be used as hypotheses for false negatives (e.g., missed detections) and using a novel set of features for each hypothesis, an off-the-shelf binary classifier can be used to find valid errors. In particular, we study two distinct cues-temporal and stereo inconsistencies--using data that are readily available on most autonomous vehicles. Our method can be used with any camera-based object detector and we illustrate the technique on several sets of real world data. We show that a state-of-the-art detector, tracker, and our classifier trained only on synthetic data can identify valid errors on KITTI tracking dataset with an average precision of 0.94. We also release a new tracking dataset with 104 sequences totaling 80,655 labeled pairs of stereo images along with ground truth disparity from a game engine to facilitate further research.

58	TestNN	Feature-Guided Black-Box Safety Testing of Deep Neural Networks	Despite the improved accuracy of deep neural networks, the discovery of adversarial examples has raised serious safety concerns. Most existing approaches for crafting adversarial examples necessitate some knowledge (architecture, parameters, etc) of the network at hand. In this paper, we focus on image classifiers and propose afeature-guidedblack-box approach to test the safety of deep neural networks that requires no such knowledge. Our algorithm employs object detection techniques such as SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) to extract features from an image. These features are converted into a mutable saliency distribution, where high probability is assigned to pixels that affect the composition of the image with respect to the human visual system. We formulate the crafting of adversarial examples as a two-player turn-based stochastic game, where the first player's objective is to minimise the distance to an adversarial example by manipulating the features, and the second player can be cooperative, adversarial, or random. We show that, theoretically, the two-player game can converge to the optimal strategy, and that the optimal strategy represents a globally minimal adversarial image. For Lipschitz networks, we also identify conditions that provide safety guarantees that no adversarial examples exist. Using Monte Carlo tree search we gradually explore the game state space to search for adversarial examples. Our experiments show that, despite the black-box setting, manipulations guided by a perception-based saliency distribution are competitive with state-of-the-art methods that rely on white-box saliency matrices or sophisticated optimization procedures. Finally, we show how our method can be used to evaluate robustness of neural networks in safety-critical applications such as traffic sign recognition in self-driving cars.

59	TestNN	Formal verification of autonomous vehicle platooning	"The coordination of multiple autonomous vehicles into convoys or platoons is expected on our highways in the near future. However, before such platoons can be deployed, the behaviours of the vehicles in these platoons must be certified. This is non-trivial and goes beyond current certification requirements, for human-controlled vehicles, in that these vehicles can act autonomously. In this paper, we show how formal verification can contribute to the analysis of these new, and increasingly autonomous, systems. An appropriate overall representation for vehicle platooning is as a multi-agent system in which each agent captures the ""autonomous decisions"" carried out by each vehicle. In order to ensure that these autonomous decision-making agents in vehicle platoons never violate safety requirements, we use formal verification. However, as the formal verification technique used to verify the individual agent's code does not scale to the full system, and as the global system verification technique does not capture the essential verification of autonomous behaviour, we use a combination of the two approaches.

60	TestNN	Game theoretic modeling of driver and vehicle interactions for verification and validation of autonomous vehicle control systems	Autonomous driving has been the subject of increased interest in recent years both in industry and in academia. Serious efforts are being pursued to address legal, technical, and logistical problems and make autonomous cars a viable option for everyday transportation. One significant challenge is the time and effort required for the verification and validation of the decision and control algorithms employed in these vehicles to ensure a safe and comfortable driving experience. Hundreds of thousands of miles of driving tests are required to achieve a well calibrated control system that is capable of operating an autonomous vehicle in an uncertain traffic environment where interactions among multiple drivers and vehicles occur simultaneously. Traffic simulators where these interactions can be modeled and represented with reasonable fidelity can help to decrease the time and effort necessary for the development of the autonomous driving control algorithms by providing a venue where acceptable initial control calibrations can be achieved quickly and safely before actual road tests. In this paper, we present a game theoretic traffic model that can be used to: 1) test and compare various autonomous vehicle decision and control systems and 2) calibrate the parameters of an existing control system.

    abstract = ""Autonomous driving has been the subject of increased interest in recent years both in industry and in academia. Serious efforts are being pursued to address legal, technical, and logistical problems and make autonomous cars a viable option for everyday transportation. One significant challenge is the time and effort required for the verification and validation of the decision and control algorithms employed in these vehicles to ensure a safe and comfortable driving experience. Hundreds of thousands of miles of driving tests are required to achieve a well calibrated control system that is capable of operating an autonomous vehicle in an uncertain traffic environment where interactions among multiple drivers and vehicles occur simultaneously. Traffic simulators where these interactions can be modeled and represented with reasonable fidelity can help to decrease the time and effort necessary for the development of the autonomous driving control algorithms by providing a venue where acceptable initial control calibrations can be achieved quickly and safely before actual road tests. In this paper, we present a game theoretic traffic model that can be used to: 1) test and compare various autonomous vehicle decision and control systems and 2) calibrate the parameters of an existing control system. We demonstrate two example case studies, where, in the first case, we test and quantitatively compare two autonomous vehicle control systems in terms of their safety and performance, and, in the second case, we optimize the parameters of an autonomous vehicle control system, utilizing the proposed traffic model and simulation environment.

Through the efforts of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) challenges in 2004--2007 timeframe, the academic and industrial communities came together to overcome some significant hurdles for the development of AO ground vehicles in both the rural and desert environments (DARPA Grand Challenge 2004--2005) and the urban environment (DARPA Urban Challenge 2007). Although no AO vehicle succeeded in the 2004 event, the following year four systems completed the 132 mile course within the 10 hour time limit. The winner of the 2005 event (The Stanley from Stanford University) designed an autonomous (learning system) vehicle that fused five Lidars, Radar, and an Electro Optic sensor in addition to the waypoint GPS (provided by DARPA) and an internal Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) system to produce the situational awareness required to meet the challenge. The team took approximately one year ""training"" the perception and planning sections of the software to compensate for various types of terrain and maneuvering. It was through extensive planning, meticulous design, and thorough testing that the final goal was achieved and it will take a much greater level of effort for DoD to realize a similar capability in the air environment.In the Air domain, DoD will not have the luxury of releasing autonomous vehicles (without significant constraints) within an operationally relevant environment (like the National Air Space (NAS)) until a very high level of confidence is achieved in their ability to perform the mission while providing a level of safety commensurate with manned operation. For DoD to succeed, it is imperative that we provide the Unmanned Air System (UAS) development community the tools required to assess all of the engineering components necessary for transition of AO vehicles into the NAS and operational environments. These tools should include a model of the required environments (emulated with access to standardized hardware/software in the loop), standard set of operational test procedures (with desired metrics), and a framework through which individual components can be assessed. It is ironic that the success of AO unmanned systems will require a structured collaborative learning process within the human domain for our goals to be realized."

62	TestNN	Micro-simulation model for assessing the risk of vehicle-pedestrian road accidents	Data on traffic accidents clearly point to road black spots, where the accident rate is always high. However, road safety research is still far from understanding why these particular places on a road are risky. The reason is the lack of sufficient knowledge on how pedestrians and drivers interact when facing a potentially dangerous traffic situation, and the lack of an integrated framework that relates the data on human behavior to real-world traffic situations. We attempt to tackle this problem by developing SAFEPED, a multi-agent microscopic three-dimensional (3D) simulation of vehicle and pedestrian dynamics at a black spot. SAFEPED is a test platform for evaluating experimentally estimated drivers and pedestrians behavioral rules, and estimating accident risks in different traffic situations. It aims to analyze the design of existing and future black spots and to assess alternative architectural and environmental solutions in order to identify maximally efficient safety countermeasures.

63	TestNN	Output Reachable Set Estimation and Verification for Multilayer Neural Networks	In this brief, the output reachable estimation and safety verification problems for multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks are addressed. First, a conception called maximum sensitivity is introduced, and for a class of MLPs whose activation functions are monotonic functions, the maximum sensitivity can be computed via solving convex optimization problems. Then, using a simulation-based method, the output reachable set estimation problem for neural networks is formulated into a chain of optimization problems. Finally, an automated safety verification is developed based on the output reachable set estimation result. An application to the safety verification for a robotic arm model with two joints is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

64	TestNN	Predictive threat assessment via reachability analysis and set invariance theory	We propose two model-based threat assessment methods for semi-autonomous vehicles, i.e., human-driven vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities. Based on information about the surrounding environment, we introduce a set of constraints on the vehicle states, which are satisfied under safe driving conditions. Then, we formulate the threat assessment problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. Vehicle and driver mathematical models are used to predict future constraint violation, indicating the possibility of accident or loss of vehicle control, hence, the need to assist the driver. The two proposed methods differ in the models used to predict vehicle motion within the surrounding environment.

65	TestNN	Risk assessment of an AUV based on an improved SFMEA method	In considering the limitations in risk assessment of AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) software systems by the traditional SFMEA (software failure modes and effects analysis) method, and on the basis of evaluating failure modes by fuzzy set theory, an improved SFMEA method based on grey region relationship was proposed. In this method, through calculating the grey region degree of relationship between the failure object and the ideal object, a quantitative risk assessment of intelligent planning and decision-making control systems of the AUV was gained, and the failure priority of the failure modes was given. Experimental results prove that the above methods can effectively solve problems which can only deal with a single value of O, S, and D by the existing SFMEA method, and improve the accuracy of the application of SFMEA methods in the AUV.

66	TestNN	Safety performance monitoring of autonomous marine systems	The marine environment is vast, harsh, and challenging. Unanticipated faults and events might lead to loss of vessels, transported goods, collected scientific data, and business reputation. Hence, systems have to be in place that monitor the safety performance of operation and indicate if it drifts into an intolerable safety level. This article proposes a process for developing safety indicators for the operation of autonomous marine systems (AMS). The condition of safety barriers and resilience engineering form the basis for the development of safety indicators, synthesizing and further adjusting the dual assurance and the resilience based early warning indicator (REWI) approaches. The article locates the process for developing safety indicators in the system life cycle emphasizing a timely implementation of the safety indicators. The resulting safety indicators reflect safety in AMS operation and can assist in planning of operations, in daily operational decision-making, and identification of improvements. Operation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) exemplifies the process for developing safety indicators and their implementation. The case study shows that the proposed process leads to a comprehensive set of safety indicators. It is expected that application of the resulting safety indicators consequently will contribute to safer operation of current and future AMS.

67	TestNN	Safety Verification of Deep Neural Networks	Deep neural networks have achieved impressive experimental results in image classification, but can surprisingly be unstable with respect to adversarial perturbations, that is, minimal changes to the input image that cause the network to misclassify it. With potential applications including perception modules and end-to-end controllers for self-driving cars, this raises concerns about their safety. We develop a novel automated verification framework for feed-forward multi-layer neural networks based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). We focus on safety of image classification decisions with respect to image manipulations, such as scratches or changes to camera angle or lighting conditions that would result in the same class being assigned by a human, and define safety for an individual decision in terms of invariance of the classification within a small neighbourhood of the original image. We enable exhaustive search of the region by employing discretisation, and propagate the analysis layer by layer. Our method works directly with the network code and, in contrast to existing methods, can guarantee that adversarial examples, if they exist, are found for the given region and family of manipulations. If found, adversarial examples can be shown to human testers and/or used to fine-tune the network. We implement the techniques using Z3 and evaluate them on state-of-the-art networks, including regularised and deep learning networks. We also compare against existing techniques to search for adversarial examples and estimate network robustness.

70	TestNN	A Flight Simulator for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Flights Over Construction Job Sites	In 2015, the construction had the highest rate of fatalities among all industries in the United States. Unsafe operation of construction equipment is one of the main causes of fatal incidents. Operation, management and interactions between construction equipment and construction crews should be thoroughly regulated to minimize the risk of fatal incidents on job sites. While use of most traditional construction equipment is regulated, the construction industry has struggled with regulating new, innovative and smart equipment such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that have recently been introduced to construction job sites. In this paper, collision avoidance and spatial safety theories in construction are discussed. The bases of these theories are extended to UAV operation in order to establish the first known theory on safe use and operation of UAVs in construction. Also, basic principles of UAV flights are discussed. By applying the basic principles of UAV flights and construction spatial safety theories, a UAV flight simulator in construction environments has been developed in Unity game engine. The flight simulator is designed for UAV pilots, construction managers and safety managers, and enables users to fly a UAV within a simulated environment extracted from a BIM model. This UAV flight simulator is tested in a case study of a building currently under construction. This simulator can be used to assess UAV pilots' capabilities, test the risks of UAV flights in any construction environment, and UAV safe flight path planning.

Operation, management and interactions between construction equipment and construction crews should be thoroughly regulated to minimize the risk of fatal incidents on job sites. While use of most traditional construction equipment is regulated, the construction industry has struggled with regulating new, innovative and smart equipment such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that have recently been introduced to construction job sites. In this paper, collision avoidance and spatial safety theories in construction are discussed. The bases of these theories are extended to UAV operation in order to establish the first known theory on safe use and operation of UAVs in construction. Also, basic principles of UAV flights are discussed. By applying the basic principles of UAV flights and construction spatial safety theories, a UAV flight simulator in construction environments has been developed in Unity game engine. The flight simulator is designed for UAV pilots, construction managers and safety managers, and enables users to fly a UAV within a simulated environment extracted from a BIM model. This UAV flight simulator is tested in a case study of a building currently under construction. This simulator can be used to assess UAV pilots' capabilities, test the risks of UAV flights in any construction environment, and UAV safe flight path planning."",

74	TestNN	Automated Synthesis of Safe Autonomous Vehicle Control Under Perception Uncertainty	Autonomous vehicles have found wide-ranging adoption in aerospace, terrestrial as well as marine use. These systems often operate in uncertain environments and in the presence of noisy sensors, and use machine learning and statistical sensor fusion algorithms to form an internal model of the world that is inherently probabilistic. Autonomous vehicles need to operate using this uncertain world-model, and hence, their correctness cannot be deterministically specified. Even once probabilistic correctness is specified, proving that an autonomous vehicle will operate correctly is a challenging problem. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a correct-by-synthesis approach to autonomous vehicle control. We propose a probabilistic extension of temporal logic, named Chance Constrained Temporal Logic (C2TL), that can be used to specify correctness requirements in presence of uncertainty. We present a novel automated synthesis technique that compiles C2TL specification into mixed integer constraints, and uses second-order (quadratic) cone programming to synthesize optimal control of autonomous vehicles subject to the C2TL specification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a diverse set of illustrative examples.

Their correctness, therefore, depends on properties of the inner ML modules. While learning algorithms aim to generalize from examples, they are only as good as the examples provided, and recent efforts have shown that they can produce inconsistent output under small adversarial perturbations. This raises the question: can the output from learning components lead to a failure of the entire CPS? In this work, we address this question by formulating it as a problem of falsifying signal temporal logic specifications for CPS with ML components. We propose a compositional falsification framework where a temporal logic falsifier and a machine learning analyzer cooperate with the aim of finding falsifying executions of the considered model.

77	TestNN	Falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning	A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a system which consists of software components and physical components. Traditional system verification techniques such as model checking or theorem proving are difficult to apply to CPS because the physical components have infinite number of states. To solve this problem, robustness guided falsification of CPS is introduced. Robustness measures how robustly the given specification is satisfied. Robustness guided falsification tries to minimize the robustness by changing inputs and parameters of the system. The input with a minimal robustness (counterexample) is a good candidate to violate the specification. Existing methods use several optimization techniques to minimize robustness. However, those methods do not use temporal structures in a system input and often require a large number of simulation runs to minimize the robustness. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, i.e., Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) and Double Deep Q Network (DDQN), to reduce the number of simulation runs required to find such counterexamples. We theoretically show how robustness guided falsification of a safety property is formatted as a reinforcement learning problem. Then, we experimentally compare the effectiveness of our methods with three baseline methods, i.e., random sampling, cross entropy and simulated annealing, on three well known CPS systems. We thoroughly analyse the experiment results and identify two factors of CPS which make DRL based methods better than existing methods. The most important factor is the availability of the system internal dynamics to the reinforcement learning algorithm. The other factor is the existence of learnable structure in the counterexample.

    abstract = ""A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a system which consists of software components and physical components. Traditional system verification techniques such as model checking or theorem proving are difficult to apply to CPS because the physical components have infinite number of states. To solve this problem, robustness guided falsification of CPS is introduced. Robustness measures how robustly the given specification is satisfied. Robustness guided falsification tries to minimize the robustness by changing inputs and parameters of the system. The input with a minimal robustness (counterexample) is a good candidate to violate the specification. Existing methods use several optimization techniques to minimize robustness. However, those methods do not use temporal structures in a system input and often require a large number of simulation runs to minimize the robustness. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, i.e., Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) and Double Deep Q Network (DDQN), to reduce the number of simulation runs required to find such counterexamples. We theoretically show how robustness guided falsification of a safety property is formatted as a reinforcement learning problem. Then, we experimentally compare the effectiveness of our methods with three baseline methods, i.e., random sampling, cross entropy and simulated annealing, on three well known CPS systems. We thoroughly analyse the experiment results and identify two factors of CPS which make DRL based methods better than existing methods. The most important factor is the availability of the system internal dynamics to the reinforcement learning algorithm. The other factor is the existence of learnable structure in the counterexample."",

They feature complex interactions that go beyond traditional communication schemes and protocols in computer systems. One distinguished feature of such complex interactions is the tight coupling between discrete and continuous interactions, captured by hybrid system models. Due to the complexity of CPSs, providing rigorous and model-based analysis methods and tools for verifying correctness of such systems is of the utmost importance. Model-based testing (MBT) is one such verification technique that can be used for checking the conformance of an implementation of a system to its specification (model).

80	TestNN	ModelPlex: verified runtime validation of verified cyber-physical system models	Formal verification and validation play a crucial role in making cyber-physical systems (CPS) safe. Formal methods make strong guarantees about the system behavior if accurate models of the system can be obtained, including models of the controller and of the physical dynamics. In CPS, models are essential; but any model we could possibly build necessarily deviates from the real world. If the real system fits to the model, its behavior is guaranteed to satisfy the correctness properties verified with respect to the model. Otherwise, all bets are off. This article introduces ModelPlex, a method ensuring that verification results about models apply to CPS implementations. ModelPlex provides correctness guarantees for CPS executions at runtime: it combines offline verification of CPS models with runtime validation of system executions for compliance with the model. ModelPlex ensures in a provably correct way that the verification results obtained for the model apply to the actual system runs by monitoring the behavior of the world for compliance with the model. If, at some point, the observed behavior no longer complies with the model so that offline verification results no longer apply, ModelPlex initiates provably safe fallback actions, assuming the system dynamics deviation is bounded. This article, furthermore, develops a systematic technique to synthesize provably correct monitors automatically from CPS proofs in differential dynamic logic by a correct-by-construction approach, leading to verifiably correct runtime model validation. Overall, ModelPlex generates provably correct monitor conditions that, if checked to hold at runtime, are provably guaranteed to imply that the offline safety verification results about the CPS model apply to the present run of the actual CPS implementation.

83	TestNN	Towards Learning and Verifying Invariants of Cyber-Physical Systems by Code Mutation	Cyber-physical systems (CPS), which integrate algorithmic control with physical processes, often consist of physically distributed components communicating over a network. A malfunctioning or compromised component in such a CPS can lead to costly consequences, especially in the context of public infrastructure. In this short paper, we argue for the importance of constructing invariants (or models) of the physical behaviour exhibited by CPS, motivated by their applications to the control, monitoring, and attestation of components. To achieve this despite the inherent complexity of CPS, we propose a new technique for learning invariants that combines machine learning with ideas from mutation testing. We present a preliminary study on a water treatment system that suggests the efficacy of this approach, propose strategies for establishing confidence in the correctness of invariants, then summarise some research questions and the steps we are taking to investigate them.

84	TestNN	Virtual Environment for Training Autonomous Vehicles	Driver assistance and semi-autonomous features are regularly added to commercial vehicles with two key stakes: collecting data for training self-driving algorithms, and using these vehicles as testbeds for these algorithms. Due to the nature of algorithms used in autonomous vehicles, their behavior in unknown situation is not fully predictable. This calls for extensive testing. In this paper, we propose to use a virtual environment for both testing algorithms for autonomous vehicles and acquiring simulated data for their training. The benefit of this environment is to able to train algorithms with realistic simulated sensor data before their deployment in real life. To this end, the proposed virtual environment has the capacity to generate similar data than real sensors (e.g. cameras, LiDar, ...). After reviewing state-of-the-art techniques and datasets available for the automotive industry, we identify that dynamic data generated on-demand is needed to improve the current results in training autonomous vehicles. Our proposition describes the benefits a virtual environment brings in improving the development, quality and confidence in the algorithms.

85	TestNN	Virtualization: System-Level Fault Simulation of SRAM Errors in Automotive Electronic Control Systems	In the coming age of self-driving cars, system-level testing of electronic control will become much more important to ensure dependable operation of automated functions. Modern VLSI devices are not always totally reliable. They can fail due to aging, electromagnetic excitation and many other reasons as described in the other chapters in this book. Therefore, dependable electronic systems must be tested against possible VLSI device failures. This may not be a common practice for meeting the ISO 26262 functional safety standard today, but deemed necessary for full-fledged self-driving cars in future. In this chapter, we demonstrate system-level simulation of SRAM errors and their impact on the design of electronic control. Automotive engine control is chosen as a test bed for this study. Model-based development techniques for automotive control systems are described first as the background and virtual electronic control units are introduced. A dependable SRAM architecture is proposed, and to test it in a practical use, a multilayer simulation modeling of an electromechanical system, its control software, and the SRAM design built-in microcontroller are discussed. To run a fault injection analysis in the SRAM chip at a large scale, a public cloud computing is used. The virtual computer machines in the cloud computing carry out the virtual engine control system simulation in which an instruction set simulator for the microcontroller executes the control software code step by step. The simulation system traces the outcome of the engine control system behavior upon a fault injection into SRAM to evaluate the dependable SRAM design. The large-scale fault analysis proposed here allows us to evaluate quantitatively the impact of the quality design of components on the entire system failure rate.

86	TestNN	Autonomous vehicle simulation model to assess potential collisions to reduce severity of impacts	Autonomous vehicle safety has received much attention in recent years. Autonomous vehicles will improve road safety by eliminating human errors. However, not all automotive collisions can be avoided. A strategy needs to be developed in the event when an autonomous vehicle encounters an unavoidable collision. Furthermore, the vehicle will need to take responsibility for the safety of its occupants, as well as any other individuals, who may be affected by the vehicle's behaviour. This paper proposes a control system to assist an autonomous vehicle to make a decision to reduce the risks to occupants potentially involved in highway motorway collisions. Before any decision can be made, the potential collisions need to be assessed for their effects. A quick and numerical method for evaluation of impact of potential collisions was developed. Assessing the Kinetic Energy of the vehicles before and after collisions is proposed as a method to assess the severity of collisions. A simulation model developed calculates the kinetic energy values and recommends an autonomous vehicle the motorway lane to drive into to cause the least severe collision impact. Different scenarios are defined and used to test the simulation model. The results obtained are promising and in line with the decision made by the subject expert.

87	TestNN	Considerations of Artificial Intelligence Safety Engineering for Unmanned Aircraft	Unmanned aircraft systems promise to be useful for a multitude of applications such as cargo transport and disaster recovery. The research on increased autonomous decision-making capabilities is therefore rapidly growing and advancing. However, the safe use, certification, and airspace integration for unmanned aircraft in a broad fashion is still unclear. Standards for development and verification of manned aircraft are either only partially applicable or resulting safety and verification efforts are unrealistic in practice due to the higher level of autonomy required by unmanned aircraft. Machine learning techniques are hard to interpret for a human and their outcome is strongly dependent on the training data. This work presents the current certification practices in unmanned aviation in the context of autonomy and artificial intelligence. Specifically, the recently introduced categories of unmanned aircraft systems and the specific operation risk assessment are described, which provide means for flight permission not solely focusing on the aircraft but also incorporating the target operation. Exemplary, we show how the specific operation risk assessment might be used as an enabler for hard-to-certify techniques by taking the operation into account during system design.

88	TestNN	DeepGauge: multi-granularity testing criteria for deep learning systems	Deep learning (DL) defines a new data-driven programming paradigm that constructs the internal system logic of a crafted neuron network through a set of training data. We have seen wide adoption of DL in many safety-critical scenarios. However, a plethora of studies have shown that the state-of-the-art DL systems suffer from various vulnerabilities which can lead to severe consequences when applied to real-world applications. Currently, the testing adequacy of a DL system is usually measured by the accuracy of test data. Considering the limitation of accessible high quality test data, good accuracy performance on test data can hardly provide confidence to the testing adequacy and generality of DL systems. Unlike traditional software systems that have clear and controllable logic and functionality, the lack of interpretability in a DL system makes system analysis and defect detection difficult, which could potentially hinder its real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose DeepGauge, a set of multi-granularity testing criteria for DL systems, which aims at rendering a multi-faceted portrayal of the testbed. The in-depth evaluation of our proposed testing criteria is demonstrated on two well-known datasets, five DL systems, and with four state-of-the-art adversarial attack techniques against DL. The potential usefulness of DeepGauge sheds light on the construction of more generic and robust DL systems.

89	TestNN	Deeproad: GaN-based metamorphic testing and input validation framework for autonomous driving systems	While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have established the fundamentals of image-based autonomous driving systems, they may exhibit erroneous behaviors and cause fatal accidents. To address the safety issues in autonomous driving systems, a recent set of testing techniques have been designed to automatically generate artificial driving scenes to enrich test suite, e.g., generating new input images transformed from the original ones. However, these techniques are insufficient due to two limitations: first, many such synthetic images often lack diversity of driving scenes, and hence compromise the resulting efficacy and reliability. Second, for machine-learning-based systems, a mismatch between training and application domain can dramatically degrade system accuracy, such that it is necessary to validate inputs for improving system robustness. In this paper, we propose DeepRoad, an unsupervised DNN-based framework for automatically testing the consistency of DNN-based autonomous driving systems and online validation. First, DeepRoad automatically synthesizes large amounts of diverse driving scenes without using image transformation rules (e.g. scale, shear and rotation). In particular, DeepRoad is able to produce driving scenes with various weather conditions (including those with rather extreme conditions) by applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with the corresponding real-world weather scenes. Second, DeepRoad utilizes metamorphic testing techniques to check the consistency of such systems using synthetic images. Third, DeepRoad validates input images for DNN-based systems by measuring the distance of the input and training images using their VGGNet features. We implement DeepRoad to test three well-recognized DNN-based autonomous driving systems in Udacity self-driving car challenge. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepRoad can detect thousands of inconsistent behaviors for these systems, and effectively validate input images to potentially enhance the system robustness as well.

90	TestNN	DLFuzz: Differential fuzzing testing of deep learning systems	Deep learning (DL) systems are increasingly applied to safetycritical domains such as autonomous driving cars. It is of significant importance to ensure the reliability and robustness of DL systems. Existing testing methodologies always fail to include rare inputs in the testing dataset and exhibit low neuron coverage. In this paper, we propose DLFuzz, the first differential fuzzing testing framework to guide DL systems exposing incorrect behaviors. DLFuzz keeps minutely mutating the input to maximize the neuron coverage and the prediction difference between the original input and the mutated input, without manual labeling effort or cross-referencing oracles from other DL systems with the same functionality.We present empirical evaluations on two well-known datasets to demonstrate its efficiency. Compared with DeepXplore, the state-of-the-art DL whitebox testing framework, DLFuzz does not require extra efforts to find similar functional DL systems for cross-referencing check, but could generate 338.59% more adversarial inputs with 89.82% smaller perturbations, averagely obtain 2.86% higher neuron coverage, and save 20.11% time consumption.

91	TestNN	Experimental Resilience Assessment of an Open-Source Driving Agent	Autonomous vehicles (AV) depend on the sensors like RADAR and camera for the perception of the environment, path planning, and control. With the increasing autonomy and interactions with the complex environment, there have been growing concerns regarding the safety and reliability of AVs. This paper presents a Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) based fault injection framework to assess the resilience of an open-source driving agent, called openpilot, under different environmental conditions and faults affecting sensor data. To increase the coverage of unsafe scenarios during testing, we use a strategic software fault-injection approach where the triggers for injecting the faults are derived from the unsafe scenarios identified during the high-level hazard analysis of the system. The experimental results show that the proposed strategic fault injection approach increases the hazard coverage compared to random fault injection and, thus, can help with more effective simulation of safety-critical faults and testing of AVs. In addition, the paper provides insights on the performance of openpilot safety mechanisms and its ability in timely detection and recovery from faulty inputs.

93	TestNN	Game theoretic modeling of driver and vehicle interactions for verification and validation of autonomous vehicle control systems	Autonomous driving has been the subject of increased interest in recent years both in industry and in academia. Serious efforts are being pursued to address legal, technical, and logistical problems and make autonomous cars a viable option for everyday transportation. One significant challenge is the time and effort required for the verification and validation of the decision and control algorithms employed in these vehicles to ensure a safe and comfortable driving experience. Hundreds of thousands of miles of driving tests are required to achieve a well calibrated control system that is capable of operating an autonomous vehicle in an uncertain traffic environment where interactions among multiple drivers and vehicles occur simultaneously. Traffic simulators where these interactions can be modeled and represented with reasonable fidelity can help to decrease the time and effort necessary for the development of the autonomous driving control algorithms by providing a venue where acceptable initial control calibrations can be achieved quickly and safely before actual road tests. In this paper, we present a game theoretic traffic model that can be used to: 1) test and compare various autonomous vehicle decision and control systems and 2) calibrate the parameters of an existing control system. We demonstrate two example case studies, where, in the first case, we test and quantitatively compare two autonomous vehicle control systems in terms of their safety and performance, and, in the second case, we optimize the parameters of an autonomous vehicle control system, utilizing the proposed traffic model and simulation environment.

94	TestNN	Eclipse plugin for automatic detection of code smells in source codes; [Kaynak kodlardaki kotu kokularin otomatik tespiti icin eclipse eklenti onerisi]	Code smells in source codes are code fragments; that do not prevent the functionality of the developed application, but which reduce code quality, make code maintenance and understandability difficult and require refactoring. Those types of smells could be found in a class as a whole or in a specific method of a class. Detecting those code smells by manual reviewing is a process that could increase the probability of unintentional omission in terms of the requirement of time, budget, and manpower as the project grows. Code smells can be caused by errors in the design phase as well as by the developer's preferences in the design to code conversion phase. In this article, we will introduce an Eclipse plugin that enables automatic detection of code smells in Java source code and presents the detected code smells to developers and maintainers. In this way, the software developers and maintainers can continuously evaluate the quality of the software with realistic values, recognize and refactor the modules that could cause a bug. This provides better quality, eas! ier maintainability and effective testability in software. The developed plugin is tested on the data sets used in fault estimation, and statistical correlation between software fault and code smells is presented. Accord! ing to results, existence of code smells is unrelated with the software faults. However, existing faults are statistically related with code smells.

Existing research has attempted to develop explanation techniques to provide interpretable explanations for each classification decision. Unfortunately, current methods are optimized for non-security tasks ( e.g., image analysis). Their key assumptions are often violated in security applications, leading to a poor explanation fidelity. In this paper, we propose LEMNA, a high-fidelity explanation method dedicated for security applications. Given an input data sample, LEMNA generates a small set of interpretable features to explain how the input sample is classified. The core idea is to approximate a local area of the complex deep learning decision boundary using a simple interpretable model. The local interpretable model is specially designed to (1) handle feature dependency to better work with security applications ( e.g., binary code analysis); and (2) handle nonlinear local boundaries to boost explanation fidelity. We evaluate our system using two popular deep learning applications in security (a malware classifier, and a function start detector for binary reverse-engineering). Extensive evaluations show that LEMNA's explanation has a much higher fidelity level compared to existing methods. In addition, we demonstrate practical use cases of LEMNA to help machine learning developers to validate model behavior, troubleshoot classification errors, and automatically patch the errors of the target models.	binary analysis;  deep recurrent neural networks;  explainable AI; binary analysis, deep recurrent neural networks, explainable AI	Guo, Wenbo; Mu, Dongliang; Xu, Jun; Su, Purui; Wang, Gang; Xing, Xinyu	CCS '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security	https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243792		364-379	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3243734.3243792,

97	TestNN	MTL Robustness for Path Planning with A*	Maintaining the safety of an autonomous drone while it executes a mission is a primary concern in presence of fixed and mobile enemies. Path planning using A* fails to deliver a feasible, safe plan when a drone has resource limitations in such environments. Enhancing A* with constraint optimization techniques may improve outcomes, but significantly increases path determination time. We define Robust A* (RA*) that introduces the use of a safety margin to maximize the robustness of the drone to meet mission requirements while managing resource restrictions. We rely on a theory of robustness based on Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) as applied to offline verification and online control of hybrid systems. By satisfying the predefined MTL constraints, RA* dynamically defines a safety margin between the drone and an enemy, while constraining the margin size given the drone's resources. The safety margin creates a robust neighborhood around the dynamically generated path. The robust neighborhood holds all valid trajectories within the current world state. When the world state changes, RA* first examines the robust neighborhood to find a valid trajectory before initiating the path re-planning. We evaluate RA* using the Rassim simulator. The results show that the algorithm generates faster and safer paths than the classical A* in the presence of moving enemies..	a*;  metric temporal logic;  path planning;  robustness; a*, metric temporal logic, path planning, robustness	Alqahtani, Sarra; Riley, Ian; Taylor, Samuel; Gamble, Rose; Mailler, Roger	AAMAS '18: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems	https://doi.org/10.5555/3237383.3237425		247-255	"""@inproceedings{10.5555/3237383.3237425,

100	TestNN	Tactical Safety Reasoning - A Case for Autonomous Vehicles	Self driving cars have recently attracted academia and industry interest. As planning algorithms become responsible for critical decisions, many questions concerning traffic safety arise. An increased automation level demands proportional impact on safety requirements, currently governed by the ISO 26262 standard. However, ISO 26262 sees safety as a functional property of a system and fails to cover emergent concerns related to autonomous decisions. In order to fill this gap we propose the field of tactical safety, which extends safety analysis to planning and execution of driving maneuvers, response to traffic events or autonomous system failures. It is meant to complement, not to replace functional safety properties of a system and allows the analysis of autonomous agents from a safe behavior point of view. We draw the requirements for tactical safety from an automotive standard which defines functional elements for advanced driving automation systems.

    abstract = ""Self driving cars have recently attracted academia and industry interest. As planning algorithms become responsible for critical decisions, many questions concerning traffic safety arise. An increased automation level demands proportional impact on safety requirements, currently governed by the ISO 26262 standard. However, ISO 26262 sees safety as a functional property of a system and fails to cover emergent concerns related to autonomous decisions. In order to fill this gap we propose the field of tactical safety, which extends safety analysis to planning and execution of driving maneuvers, response to traffic events or autonomous system failures. It is meant to complement, not to replace functional safety properties of a system and allows the analysis of autonomous agents from a safe behavior point of view. We draw the requirements for tactical safety from an automotive standard which defines functional elements for advanced driving automation systems."",

A biologically-inspired swarm control theory provides a framework to distribute sensor payloads between several smaller and less complex agents that have local interactions. Controller design and flight testing of large UASs with high speeds and high inertias holding a formation in a dynamically changing environment and in the presence of external disturbances is complex and requires advanced planning and safety measures. Verification and validation flight tests were conducted using a fixed-wing unmanned aerial system with 4 meter wingspans to investigate the robustness of the guidance, navigation, and control algorithms and also test the embedded morphing potential field collision avoidance logic.

102	TestNN	AILiveSim: An extensible virtual environment for training autonomous vehicles	Virtualization technologies have become common-place both in software development as well as engineering in a more general sense. Using virtualization offers other benefits than simulation and testing as a virtual environment can often be more liberally configured than the corresponding physical environment. This, in turn, introduces new possibilities for education and training, including both for humans and artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, we are developing a simulation platform AILiveSim. The platform is built on top of the Unreal Engine (www.unrealengine.com) game development system, and it is dedicated to training and testing autonomous systems, their sensors and their algorithms in a simulated environment. In this paper, we describe the elements that we have built on top of the engine to realize a Virtual Environment (VE) useful for the design, implementation, application and analysis of autonomous systems. We present the architecture that we have put in place to transform our simulation platform from automotive specific to be domain agnostic and support two new domains of applications: autonomous ships and autonomous mining machines. We describe the important specificity of each domain in regard to simulation.In addition, we also report the challenges encountered when simulating those applications, and the decisions taken to overcome these challenges.

103	TestNN	Compositional Falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems with Machine Learning Components	Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as automotive systems, are starting to include sophisticated machine learning (ML) components. Their correctness, therefore, depends on properties of the inner ML modules. While learning algorithms aim to generalize from examples, they are only as good as the examples provided, and recent efforts have shown that they can produce inconsistent output under small adversarial perturbations. This raises the question: can the output from learning components lead to a failure of the entire CPS? In this work, we address this question by formulating it as a problem of falsifying signal temporal logic specifications for CPS with ML components. We propose a compositional falsification framework where a temporal logic falsifier and a machine learning analyzer cooperate with the aim of finding falsifying executions of the considered model. The efficacy of the proposed technique is shown on an automatic emergency braking system model with a perception component based on deep neural networks.

    abstract = ""Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as automotive systems, are starting to include sophisticated machine learning (ML) components. Their correctness, therefore, depends on properties of the inner ML modules. While learning algorithms aim to generalize from examples, they are only as good as the examples provided, and recent efforts have shown that they can produce inconsistent output under small adversarial perturbations. This raises the question: can the output from learning components lead to a failure of the entire CPS? In this work, we address this question by formulating it as a problem of falsifying signal temporal logic specifications for CPS with ML components. We propose a compositional falsification framework where a temporal logic falsifier and a machine learning analyzer cooperate with the aim of finding falsifying executions of the considered model. The efficacy of the proposed technique is shown on an automatic emergency braking system model with a perception component based on deep neural networks. (c) 2019, Springer Nature B.V."",

104	TestNN	Safety assurance strategies for autonomous vehicles	Assuring safety of autonomous vehicles requires that the vehicle control system can perceive the situation in the environment and react to actions of other entities. One approach to vehicle safety assurance is based on the assumption that hazardous sequences of events should be identified during hazard analysis and then some means of hazard avoidance and mitigation, like barriers, should be designed and implemented. Another approach is to design a system which is able to dynamically examine the risk associated with possible actions and then select the safest action to carry it out. Dynamic risk assessment requires maintaining the situation awareness and prediction of possible future situations. We analyse how these two approaches can be applied for autonomous vehicles and what strategies can be used for safety argumentation.

106	TestNN	Adaptive verification for an on-line learning neural-based flight control system	This paper presents a complex adaptive systems approach for the verification of an adaptive, online learning, sigma-pi neural network that is used for the Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS) that has the potential of commercial aviation application. This paper reports on the partial completion of my doctoral dissertation proposal at Nova Southeastern University, in the Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences. The most significant shortcoming of the prior and current approaches to verifying adaptive neural networks is the application of linear approaches to a non-linear problem. The project will use a MatLab simulation of the sigma-pi adaptive neural network and an aircraft simulation to fly a series of simulated flight tests. As a result of the flight simulations, a statistical analysis of the neural network weights is performed as input to both a complexity analysis and a neural network rule extraction analysis. Complex adaptive methods are a novel approach to overcome previous linear analysis limitations. Future work will be required to analyze emergent behavior of the neural network weights to show stability and convergence characteristics. Advances in computational power and neural network techniques for estimating aerodynamic stability and control derivatives provide opportunity for real-time adaptive control. New verification techniques are needed that substantially increases trustworthiness in the use of these neural network systems in life critical systems. Verification of neural-based IFCS is currently an urgent and significant research and engineering topic since these systems are being looked upon as a new approach for aircraft survivability, for both commercial and military.

107	TestNN	An Abstraction-Refinement Approach to Verification of Artificial Neural Networks	A key problem in the adoption of artificial neural networks in safety-related applications is that misbehaviors can be hardly ruled out with traditional analytical or probabilistic techniques. In this paper we focus on specific networks known as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and we propose a solution to verify their safety using abstractions to Boolean combinations of linear arithmetic constraints. We show that our abstractions are consistent, i.e., whenever the abstract MLP is declared to be safe, the same holds for the concrete one. Spurious counterexamples, on the other hand, trigger refinements and can be leveraged to automate the correction of misbehaviors. We describe an implementation of our approach based on theHySATsolver, detailing the abstraction-refinement process and the automated correction strategy. Finally, we present experimental results confirming the feasibility of our approach on a realistic case study.

108	TestNN	NeVer: a tool for artificial neural networks verification	The adoption of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in safety-related applications is often avoided because it is difficult to rule out possible misbehaviors with traditional analytical or probabilistic techniques. In this paper we present NeVer, our tool for checking safety of ANNs. NeVerencodes the problem of verifying safety of ANNs into the problem of satisfying corresponding Boolean combinations of linear arithmetic constraints. We describe the main verification algorithm and the structure of NeVer. We present also empirical results confirming the effectiveness of NeVeron realistic case studies.

109	TestNN	Challenging SMT solvers to verify neural networks	In recent years, Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are becoming increasingly popular in the Computer Aided Verification and Reasoning community. Used natively or as back-engines, they are accumulating a record of success stories and, as witnessed by the annual SMT competition, their performances and capacity are also increasing steadily. Introduced in previous contributions of ours, a new application domain providing an outstanding challenge for SMT solvers is represented by verification of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) a widely-adopted kind of artificial neural network. In this paper we present an extensive evaluation of the current state-of-the-art SMT solvers and assess their potential in the promising domain of MLP verification.

111	TestNN	Toward guaranteed illumination models for non-convex objects	Illumination variation remains a central challenge in object detection and recognition. Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambert Ian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense. We show that it is possible to build models for the set of images across illumination variation with worst-case performance guarantees, for nonconvex Lambertian objects. Namely, a natural verification test based on the distance to the model guarantees to accept any image which can be sufficiently well-approximated by an image of the object under some admissible lighting condition, and guarantees to reject any image that does not have a sufficiently good approximation. These models are generated by sampling illumination directions with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation bound for directional illuminated images in the Lambertian model. As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model.

112	TestNN	Deep inside convolutional networks: Visualising image classification models and saliency maps	This paper addresses the visualisation of image classification models, learnt using deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets). We consider two visualisation techniques, based on computing the gradient of the class score with respect to the input image. The first one generates an image, which maximises the class score [5], thus visualising the notion of the class, captured by a ConvNet. The second technique computes a class saliency map, specific to a given image and class. We show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using classification ConvNets. Finally, we establish the connection between the gradient-based ConvNet visualisation methods and deconvolutional networks [13].

113	TestNN	AxNN: Energy-efficient neuromorphic systems using approximate computing	Neuromorphic algorithms, which are comprised of highly complex, large-scale networks of artificial neurons, are increasingly used for a variety of recognition, classification, search and vision tasks. However, their computational and energy requirements can be quite high, and hence their energy-efficient implementation is of great interest. We propose a new approach to design energy-efficient hardware implementations of large-scale neural networks (NNs) using approximate computing. Our work is motivated by the observations that (i) NNs are used in applications where less-than-perfect results are acceptable, and often inevitable, and (ii) they are highly resilient to inexactness in many (but not all) of their constituent computations. We make two key contributions. First, we propose a method to transform any given NN into an Approximate Neural Network (AxNN). This is performed by (i) adapting the backpropagation technique, which is commonly used to train these networks, to quantify the impact of approximating each neuron to the overall network quality (e.g., classification accuracy), and (ii) selectively approximating those neurons that impact network quality the least. Further, we make the key observation that training is a naturally error-healing process that can be used to mitigate the impact of approximations to neurons. Therefore, we incrementally retrain the network with the approximations in-place, reclaiming a significant portion of the quality ceded by approximations. As a second contribution, we propose a programmable and quality-configurable neuromorphic processing engine (qcNPE), which utilizes arrays of specialized processing elements that execute neuron computations with dynamically configurable accuracies and can be used to execute AxNNs from diverse applications. We evaluated the proposed approach by constructing AXNNs for 6 recognition applications (ranging in complexity from 12-47,818 neurons and 160-3,155,968 connections) and executing them on two different platforms-qcNPE implementation containing 272 processing elements in 45nm technology and a commodity Intel Xeon server. Our results demonstrate 1.14X-1.92X energy benefits for virtually no loss (< 0.5%) in output quality, and even higher improvements (upto 2.3X) when some loss (upto 7.5%) in output quality is acceptable.

115	TestNN	Towards deep neural network architectures robust to adversarial examples	Recent work has shown deep neural networks (DNNs) to be highly susceptible to well-designed, small perturbations at the input layer, or so-called adversarial examples. Taking images as an example, such distortions are often imperceptible, but can result in 100% mis-classification for a state of the art DNN. We study the structure of adversarial examples and explore network topology, pre-processing and training strategies to improve the robustness of DNNs. We perform various experiments to assess the removability of adversarial examples by corrupting with additional noise and pre-processing with denoising autoencoders (DAEs). We find that DAEs can remove substantial amounts of the adversarial noise. However, when stacking the DAE with the original DNN, the resulting network can again be attacked by new adversarial examples with even smaller distortion. As a solution, we propose Deep Contractive Network, a model with a new end-to-end training procedure that includes a smoothness penalty inspired by the contractive autoencoder (CAE). This increases the network robustness to adversarial examples, without a significant performance penalty.

119	TestNN	Deep neural networks are easily fooled: High confidence predictions for unrecognizable images	"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study [30] revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call ""fooling images"" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise questions about the generality of DNN computer vision."

121	TestNN	Understanding Adversarial Training: Increasing Local Stability of Neural Nets through Robust Optimization	We propose a general framework for increasing local stability of Artificial Neural Nets (ANNs) using Robust Optimization (RO). We achieve this through an alternating minimization-maximization procedure, in which the loss of the network is minimized over perturbed examples that are generated at each parameter update. We show that adversarial training of ANNs is in fact robustification of the network optimization, and that our proposed framework generalizes previous approaches for increasing local stability of ANNs. Experimental results reveal that our approach increases the robustness of the network to existing adversarial examples, while making it harder to generate new ones. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the accuracy of the network also on the original test data.

122	TestNN	Understanding deep image representations by inverting them	Image representations, from SIFT and Bag of Visual Words to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are a crucial component of almost any image understanding system. Nevertheless, our understanding of them remains limited. In this paper we conduct a direct analysis of the visual information contained in representations by asking the following question: given an encoding of an image, to which extent is it possible to reconstruct the image itself? To answer this question we contribute a general framework to invert representations. We show that this method can invert representations such as HOG more accurately than recent alternatives while being applicable to CNNs too. We then use this technique to study the inverse of recent state-of-the-art CNN image representations for the first time. Among our findings, we show that several layers in CNNs retain photographically accurate information about the image, with different degrees of geometric and photometric invariance.

123	TestNN	Distilling Knowledge from Deep Networks with Applications to Healthcare Domain	Exponential growth in Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) has resulted in new opportunities and urgent needs for discovery of meaningful data-driven representations and patterns of diseases in Computational Phenotyping research. Deep Learning models have shown superior performance for robust prediction in computational phenotyping tasks, but suffer from the issue of model interpretability which is crucial for clinicians involved in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a novel knowledge-distillation approach called Interpretable Mimic Learning, to learn interpretable phenotype features for making robust prediction while mimicking the performance of deep learning models. Our framework uses Gradient Boosting Trees to learn interpretable features from deep learning models such as Stacked Denoising Autoencoder and Long Short-Term Memory. Exhaustive experiments on a real-world clinical time-series dataset show that our method obtains similar or better performance than the deep learning models, and it provides interpretable phenotypes for clinical decision making.

124	TestNN	Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network	A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.

125	TestNN	On pixel-wise explanations for non-linear classifier decisions by layer-wise relevance propagation	Understanding and interpreting classification decisions of automated image classification systems is of high value in many applications, as it allows to verify the reasoning of the system and provides additional information to the human expert. Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision. This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest.We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on PASCAL VOC 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the MNIST handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained ImageNet model available as part of the Caffe open source package.

127	TestNN	Attentive Explanations: Justifying Decisions and Pointing to the Evidence	Deep models are the defacto standard in visual decision models due to their impressive performance on a wide array of visual tasks. However, they are frequently seen as opaque and are unable to explain their decisions. In contrast, humans can justify their decisions with natural language and point to the evidence in the visual world which led to their decisions. We postulate that deep models can do this as well and propose our Pointing and Justification (PJ-X) model which can justify its decision with a sentence and point to the evidence by introspecting its decision and explanation process using an attention mechanism. Unfortunately there is no dataset available with reference explanations for visual decision making. We thus collect two datasets in two domains where it is interesting and challenging to explain decisions. First, we extend the visual question answering task to not only provide an answer but also a natural language explanation for the answer. Second, we focus on explaining human activities which is traditionally more challenging than object classification. We extensively evaluate our PJ-X model, both on the justification and pointing tasks, by comparing it to prior models and ablations using both automatic and human evaluations.

128	TestNN	Concrete Problems in AI Safety	"Rapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society. In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function (""avoiding side effects"" and ""avoiding reward hacking""), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently (""scalable supervision""), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (""safe exploration"" and ""distributional shift""). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI."

129	TestNN	Distillation as a Defense to Adversarial Perturbations Against Deep Neural Networks	Deep learning algorithms have been shown to perform extremely well on many classical machine learning problems. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural network (DNN) to provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can seriously undermine the security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems can be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a defensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the generalizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation from 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 1030. We also find that distillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be modified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we tested.

130	TestNN	Improving the Robustness of Deep Neural Networks via Stability Training	In this paper we address the issue of output instability of deep neural networks: small perturbations in the visual input can significantly distort the feature embeddings and output of a neural network. Such instability affects many deep architectures with state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of computer vision tasks. We present a general stability training method to stabilize deep networks against small input distortions that result from various types of common image processing, such as compression, rescaling, and cropping. We validate our method by stabilizing the state of-the-art Inception architecture [11] against these types of distortions. In addition, we demonstrate that our stabilized model gives robust state-of-the-art performance on largescale near-duplicate detection, similar-image ranking, and classification on noisy datasets.

131	TestNN	Measuring neural net robustness with constraints	"Despite having high accuracy, neural nets have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial examples, where a small perturbation to an input can cause it to become mislabeled. We propose metrics for measuring the robustness of a neural net and devise a novel algorithm for approximating these metrics based on an encoding of robustness as a linear program. We show how our metrics can be used to evaluate the robustness of deep neural nets with experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our algorithm generates more informative estimates of robustness metrics compared to estimates based on existing algorithms. Furthermore, we show how existing approaches to improving robustness ""overfit"" to adversarial examples generated using a specific algorithm. Finally, we show that our techniques can be used to additionally improve neural net robustness both according to the metrics that we propose, but also according to previously proposed metrics."

132	TestNN	Policy compression for aircraft collision avoidance systems	One approach to designing the decision making logic for an aircraft collision avoidance system is to frame the problem as Markov decision process and optimize the system using dynamic programming. The resulting strategy can be represented as a numeric table. This methodology has been used in the development of the ACAS X family of collision avoidance systems for manned and unmanned aircraft. However, due to the high dimensionality of the state space, discretizing the state variables can lead to very large tables. To improve storage efficiency, we propose two approaches for compressing the lookup table. The first approach exploits redundancy in the table. The table is decomposed into a set of lower-dimensional tables, some of which can be represented by single tables in areas where the lower-dimensional tables are identical or nearly identical with respect to a similarity metric. The second approach uses a deep neural network to learn a complex non-linear function approximation of the table. With the use of an asymmetric loss function and a gradient descent algorithm, the parameters for this network can be trained to provide very accurate estimates of values while preserving the relative preferences of the possible advisories for each state. As a result, the table can be approximately represented by only the parameters of the network, which reduces the required storage space by a factor of 1000. Simulation studies show that system performance is very similar using either compressed table representation in place of the original table. Even though the neural network was trained directly on the original table, the network surpasses the original table on the performance metrics and encounter sets evaluated here.

Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a method to compute scores for individual components of an input image, denoting their contribution to the prediction of the classifier for one particular test point.

137	TestNN	Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization	In this work, we revisit the global average pooling layer proposed in [13], and shed light on how it explicitly enables the convolutional neural network (CNN) to have remarkable localization ability despite being trained on imagelevel labels. While this technique was previously proposed as a means for regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic localizable deep representation that exposes the implicit attention of CNNs on an image. Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014 without training on any bounding box annotation. We demonstrate in a variety of experiments that our network is able to localize the discriminative image regions despite just being trained for solving classification task1.

140	TestNN	TreeView: Peeking into Deep Neural Networks Via Feature-Space Partitioning	With the advent of highly predictive but opaque deep learning models, it has become more important than ever to understand and explain the predictions of such models. Existing approaches define interpretability as the inverse of complexity and achieve interpretability at the cost of accuracy. This introduces a risk of producing interpretable but misleading explanations. As humans, we are prone to engage in this kind of behavior \cite{mythos}. In this paper, we take a step in the direction of tackling the problem of interpretability without compromising the model accuracy. We propose to build a Treeview representation of the complex model via hierarchical partitioning of the feature space, which reveals the iterative rejection of unlikely class labels until the correct association is predicted.

141	TestNN	Verifying properties of binarized deep neural networks	Understanding properties of deep neural networks is an important challenge in deep learning. In this paper, we take a step in this direction by proposing a rigorous way of verifying properties of a popular class of neural networks, Binarized Neural Networks, using the well-developed means of Boolean satisfiability. Our main contribution is a construction that creates a representation of a binarized neural network as a Boolean formula. Our encoding is the firstexactBoolean representation of a deep neural network. Using this encoding, we leverage the power of modern SAT solvers along with a proposed counterexample-guided search procedure to verify various properties of these networks. A particular focus will be on the critical property of robustness to adversarial perturbations. For this property, our experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales to medium-size deep neural networks used in image classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on verifying properties of deep neural networks using an exact Boolean encoding of the network.

144	TestNN	Output Range Analysis for Deep Neural Networks	"Deep neural networks (NN) are extensively used for machine learning tasks such as image classification, perception and control of autonomous systems. Increasingly, these deep NNs are also been deployed in high-assurance applications. Thus, there is a pressing need for developing techniques to verify neural networks to check whether certain user-expected properties are satisfied. In this paper, we study a specific verification problem of computing a guaranteed range for the output of a deep neural network given a set of inputs represented as a convex polyhedron. Range estimation is a key primitive for verifying deep NNs. We present an efficient range estimation algorithm that uses a combination of local search and linear programming problems to efficiently find the maximum and minimum values taken by the outputs of the NN over the given input set. In contrast to recently proposed ""monolithic"" optimization approaches, we use local gradient descent to repeatedly find and eliminate local minima of the function. The final global optimum is certified using a mixed integer programming instance. We implement our approach and compare it with Reluplex, a recently proposed solver for deep neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for verification of NNs used in automated control as well as those used in classification."

145	TestNN	Formal Verification of Piece-Wise Linear Feed-Forward Neural Networks	We present an approach for the verification of feed-forward neural networks in which all nodes have a piece-wise linear activation function. Such networks are often used in deep learning and have been shown to be hard to verify for modern satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and integer linear programming (ILP) solvers.The starting point of our approach is the addition of a global linear approximation of the overall network behavior to the verification problem that helps with SMT-like reasoning over the network behavior. We present a specialized verification algorithm that employs this approximation in a search process in which it infers additional node phases for the non-linear nodes in the network from partial node phase assignments, similar to unit propagation in classical SAT solving. We also show how to infer additional conflict clauses and safe node fixtures from the results of the analysis steps performed during the search. The resulting approach is evaluated on collision avoidance and handwritten digit recognition case studies.

146	TestNN	DeepSafe: A Data-Driven Approach for Assessing Robustness of Neural Networks	Deep neural networks have achieved impressive results in many complex applications, including classification tasks for image and speech recognition, pattern analysis or perception in self-driving vehicles. However, it has been observed that even highly trained networks are very vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Adding minimal changes to inputs that are correctly classified can lead to wrong predictions, raising serious security and safety concerns. Existing techniques for checking robustness against such perturbations only consider searching locally around a few individual inputs, providing limited guarantees. We propose DeepSafe, a novel approach for automatically assessing the overall robustness of a neural network. DeepSafe applies clustering over known labeled data and leverages off-the-shelf constraint solvers to automatically identify and check safe regions in which the network is robust, i.e. all the inputs in the region are guaranteed to be classified correctly. We also introduce the concept of targeted robustness, which ensures that the neural network is guaranteed not to misclassify inputs within a region to a specific target (adversarial) label. We evaluate DeepSafe on a neural network implementation of a controller for the next-generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu) and for the well known MNIST network. For these networks, DeepSafe identified many regions which were safe, and also found adversarial perturbations of interest.

147	TestNN	The challenge of verification and testing of machine learning	"In our second post, we gave some background explaining why attacking machine learning is often easier than defending it. We saw some of the reasons why we do not yet have completely effective defenses against adversarial examples, and we speculated about whether we can ever expect such a defense.

In this post, we explore the types of guarantees one can expect a machine learning model to possess. We argue that the limitations of existing defenses point to the lack of verification of machine learning models. Indeed, to design reliable systems, engineers typically engage in both testing and verification:

By testing, we mean evaluating the system in several conditions and observing its behavior, watching for defects.

By verification, we mean producing a compelling argument that the system will not misbehave under a very broad range of circumstances.

Orthogonal to this issue is the question of which input values should be subject to verification and testing.

149	TestNN	Extending Defensive Distillation	Machine learning is vulnerable to adversarial examples: inputs carefully modified to force misclassification. Designing defenses against such inputs remains largely an open problem. In this work, we revisit defensive distillation---which is one of the mechanisms proposed to mitigate adversarial examples---to address its limitations. We view our results not only as an effective way of addressing some of the recently discovered attacks but also as reinforcing the importance of improved training techniques.

150	TestNN	Feature Squeezing: Detecting Adversarial Examples in Deep Neural Networks	Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in many tasks, they can often be fooled by adversarial examples that are generated by adding small but purposeful distortions to natural examples. Previous studies to defend against adversarial examples mostly focused on refining the DNN models, but have either shown limited success or required expensive computation. We propose a new strategy, feature squeezing, that can be used to harden DNN models by detecting adversarial examples. Feature squeezing reduces the search space available to an adversary by coalescing samples that correspond to many different feature vectors in the original space into a single sample. By comparing a DNN model's prediction on the original input with that on squeezed inputs, feature squeezing detects adversarial examples with high accuracy and few false positives. This paper explores two feature squeezing methods: reducing the color bit depth of each pixel and spatial smoothing. These simple strategies are inexpensive and complementary to other defenses, and can be combined in a joint detection framework to achieve high detection rates against state-of-the-art attacks.

151	TestNN	On Detecting Adversarial Perturbations	"Machine learning and deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on perceptual tasks in recent years. However, it remains vulnerable against adversarial perturbations of the input that have been crafted specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible to a human. In this work, we propose to augment deep neural networks with a small ""detector"" subnetwork which is trained on the binary classification task of distinguishing genuine data from data containing adversarial perturbations. Our method is orthogonal to prior work on addressing adversarial perturbations, which has mostly focused on making the classification network itself more robust. We show empirically that adversarial perturbations can be detected surprisingly well even though they are quasi-imperceptible to humans. Moreover, while the detectors have been trained to detect only a specific adversary, they generalize to similar and weaker adversaries. In addition, we propose an adversarial attack that fools both the classifier and the detector and a novel training procedure for the detector that counteracts this attack."

152	TestNN	Parseval networks: Improving robustness to adversarial examples	We introduce Parseval networks, a form of deep neural networks in which the Lipschitz constant of linear, convolutional and aggregation layers is constrained to be smaller than 1. Parseval networks are empirically and theoretically motivated by an analysis of the robustness of the predictions made by deep neural networks when their input is subject to an adversarial perturbation. The most important feature of Parseval networks is to maintain weight matrices of linear and convolutional layers to be (approximately) Parseval tight frames, which are extensions of orthogonal matrices to non-square matrices. We describe how these constraints can be maintained efficiently during SGD. We show that Parseval networks match the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and Street View House Numbers (SVHN), while being more robust than their vanilla counterpart against adversarial examples. Incidentally, Parseval networks also tend to train faster and make a better usage of the full capacity of the networks.

156	TestNN	Axiomatic attribution for deep networks	We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to its input features, a problem previously studied by several other works. We identify two fundamental axioms--SensitivityandImplementation Invariancethat attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method calledIntegrated Gradients.Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.

157	TestNN	Explaining nonlinear classification decisions with deep Taylor decomposition	Nonlinear methods such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the gold standard for various challenging machine learning problems such as image recognition. Although these methods perform impressively well, they have a significant disadvantage, the lack of transparency, limiting the interpretability of the solution and thus the scope of application in practice. Especially DNNs act as black boxes due to their multilayer nonlinear structure. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for interpreting generic multilayer neural networks by decomposing the network classification decision into contributions of its input elements. Although our focus is on image classification, the method is applicable to a broad set of input data, learning tasks and network architectures. Our method called deep Taylor decomposition efficiently utilizes the structure of the network by backpropagating the explanations from the output to the input layer. We evaluate the proposed method empirically on the MNIST and ILSVRC data sets.

158	TestNN	Improving Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks with Semantic Information	Interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is essential since it enables users to understand the overall strengths and weaknesses of the models, conveys an understanding of how the models will behave in the future, and how to diagnose and correct potential problems. However, it is challenging to reason about what a DNN actually does due to its opaque or black-box nature. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique to improve the interpretability of DNNs by leveraging the rich semantic information embedded in human descriptions. By concentrating on the video captioning task, we first extract a set of semantically meaningful topics from the human descriptions that cover a wide range of visual concepts, and integrate them into the model with an interpretive loss. We then propose a prediction difference maximization algorithm to interpret the learned features of each neuron. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in video captioning using the interpretable features, which can also be transferred to video action recognition. By clearly understanding the learned features, users can easily revise false predictions via a human-in-the-loop procedure.

159	TestNN	Interpretability via Model Extraction	The ability to interpret machine learning models has become increasingly important now that machine learning is used to inform consequential decisions. We propose an approach called model extraction for interpreting complex, blackbox models. Our approach approximates the complex model using a much more interpretable model; as long as the approximation quality is good, then statistical properties of the complex model are reflected in the interpretable model. We show how model extraction can be used to understand and debug random forests and neural nets trained on several datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, as well as control policies learned for several classical reinforcement learning problems.

162	TestNN	Right for the right reasons:training differentiable models by constraining their explanations	Neural networks are among the most accurate supervised learning methods in use today. However, their opacity makes them difficult to trust in critical applications, especially if conditions in training may differ from those in test. Recent work on explanations for black-box models has produced tools (e.g. LIME) to show the implicit rules behind predictions. These tools can help us identify when models are right for the wrong reasons. However, these methods do not scale to explaining entire datasets and cannot correct the problems they reveal. We introduce a method for efficiently explaining and regularizing differentiable models by examining and selectively penalizing their input gradients. We apply these penalties both based on expert annotation and in an unsupervised fashion that produces multiple classifiers with qualitatively different decision boundaries. On multiple datasets, we show our approach generates faithful explanations and models that generalize much better when conditions differ between training and test.		Andrew Slavin Ross; Michael C.

163	TestNN	A simple neural network module for relational reasoning	Relational reasoning is a central component of generally intelligent behavior, but has proven difficult for neural networks to learn. In this paper we describe how to use Relation Networks (RNs) as a simple plug-and-play module to solve problems that fundamentally hinge on relational reasoning. We tested RN-augmented networks on three tasks: visual question answering using a challenging dataset called CLEVR, on which we achieve state-of-the-art, super-human performance; text-based question answering using the bAbI suite of tasks; and complex reasoning about dynamic physical systems. Then, using a curated dataset called Sort-of-CLEVR we show that powerful convolutional networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational questions, but can gain this capacity when augmented with RNs. Thus, by simply augmenting convolutions, LSTMs, and MLPs with RNs, we can remove computational burden from network components that are not well-suited to handle relational reasoning, reduce overall network complexity, and gain a general ability to reason about the relations between entities and their properties.

164	TestNN	A unified approach to interpreting model predictions	Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension betweenaccuracyandinterpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.		Scott M.

165	TestNN	Verification of Binarized Neural Networks via Inter-neuron Factoring	Binarized Neural Networks (BNN) have recently been proposed as an energy-efficient alternative to more traditional learning networks. Here we study the problem of formally verifying BNNs by reducing it to a corresponding hardware verification problem. The main step in this reduction is based on factoring computations among neurons within a hidden layer of the BNN in order to make the BNN verification problem more scalable in practice. The main contributions of this paper include results on the NP-hardness and hardness of PTAS approximability of this essential optimization and factoring step, and we design polynomial-time search heuristics for generating approximate factoring solutions. With these techniques we are able to scale the verification problem to moderately-sized BNNs for embedded devices with thousands of neurons and inputs.

Here we study the problem of formally verifying BNNs by reducing it to a corresponding hardware verification problem. The main step in this reduction is based on factoring computations among neurons within a hidden layer of the BNN in order to make the BNN verification problem more scalable in practice. The main contributions of this paper include results on the NP-hardness and hardness of PTAS approximability of this essential optimization and factoring step, and we design polynomial-time search heuristics for generating approximate factoring solutions. With these techniques we are able to scale the verification problem to moderately-sized BNNs for embedded devices with thousands of neurons and inputs."",

167	TestNN	A game-based approximate verification of deep neural networks with provable guarantees	Despite the improved accuracy of deep neural networks, the discovery of adversarial examples has raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we study two variants of pointwise robustness, themaximum safe radiusproblem, which for a given input sample computes the minimum distance to an adversarial example, and thefeature robustnessproblem, which aims to quantify the robustness of individual features to adversarial perturbations. We demonstrate that, under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, both problems can be approximated using finite optimisation by discretising the input space, and the approximation has provable guarantees, i.e., the error is bounded. We then show that the resulting optimisation problems can be reduced to the solution of two-player turn-based games, where the first player selects features and the second perturbs the image within the feature. While the second player aims to minimise the distance to an adversarial example, depending on the optimisation objective the first player can be cooperative or competitive. We employ an anytime approach to solve the games, in the sense of approximating the value of a game by monotonically improving its upper and lower bounds. The Monte Carlo tree search algorithm is applied to compute upper bounds for both games, and the Admissible A*and the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms are, respectively, used to compute lower bounds for the maximum safety radius and feature robustness games. When working on the upper bound of the maximum safe radius problem, our tool demonstrates competitive performance against existing adversarial example crafting algorithms. Furthermore, we show how our framework can be deployed to evaluate pointwise robustness of neural networks in safety-critical applications such as traffic sign recognition in self-driving cars.

We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute these explanations for any black-box model with high-probability guarantees. We demonstrate the flexibility of anchors by explaining a myriad of different models for different domains and tasks. In a user study, we show that anchors enable users to predict how a model would behave on unseen instances with less effort and higher precision, as compared to existing linear explanations or no explanations."

169	TestNN	Global-and-local attention networks for visual recognition	"Most recent gains in machine vision have originated from the development of network architectures which incorporate some form of attention. While biology is sometimes mentioned as a source of inspiration, the attentional mechanisms that have been considered by the computer vision community remain limited in comparison to the richness and diversity of the processes used by our visual system. Here, we describe a biologicallymotivated ""global-and-local attention"" (GALA) module which is shown to yield state-of-the-art object recognition accuracy when embedded in a modern deep neural network. We further describe ClickMe.ai, a largescale online experiment designed for human participants to identify diagnostic image regions for visual recognition in order to co-train a GALA network. Adding humans-inthe-loop is shown to significantly improve network accuracy, while also yielding visual representations that are more interpretable and more similar to those used by human observers."

171	TestNN	Learning Functional Causal Models with Generative Neural Networks	"We introduce a new approach to functional causal modeling from observational data, calledCausal Generative Neural Networks(CGNN). CGNN leverages the power of neural networks to learn a generative model of the joint distribution of the observed variables, by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between generated and observed data. An approximate learning criterion is proposed to scale the computational cost of the approach to linear complexity in the number of observations. The performance of CGNN is studied throughout three experiments. Firstly, CGNN is applied to cause-effect inference, where the task is to identify the best causal hypothesis out of ""X-Y"" and ""Y-X"". Secondly, CGNN is applied to the problem of identifying v-structures and conditional independences. Thirdly, CGNN is applied to multivariate functional causal modeling: given a skeleton describing the direct dependences in a set of random variablesX= [X1, ...,Xd], CGNN orients the edges in the skeleton to uncover the directed acyclic causal graph describing the causal structure of the random variables. On all three tasks, CGNN is extensively assessed on both artificial and real-world data, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art. Finally, CGNN is extended to handle the case of confounders, where latent variables are involved in the overall causal model."

172	TestNN	Learning Global Additive Explanations for Neural Nets Using Model Distillation	Interpretability has largely focused on local explanations, i.e. explaining why a model made a particular prediction for a sample. These explanations are appealing due to their simplicity and local fidelity. However, they do not provide information about the general behavior of the model. We propose to leverage model distillation to learn global additive explanations that describe the relationship between input features and model predictions. These global explanations take the form of feature shapes, which are more expressive than feature attributions. Through careful experimentation, we show qualitatively and quantitatively that global additive explanations are able to describe model behavior and yield insights about models such as neural nets.

174	TestNN	Local Rule-Based Explanations of Black Box Decision Systems	The recent years have witnessed the rise of accurate but obscure decision systems which hide the logic of their internal decision processes to the users. The lack of explanations for the decisions of black box systems is a key ethical issue, and a limitation to the adoption of machine learning components in socially sensitive and safety-critical contexts. %Therefore, we need explanations that reveals the reasons why a predictor takes a certain decision. In this paper we focus on the problem of black box outcome explanation, i.e., explaining the reasons of the decision taken on a specific instance. We propose LORE, an agnostic method able to provide interpretable and faithful explanations. LORE first leans a local interpretable predictor on a synthetic neighborhood generated by a genetic algorithm. Then it derives from the logic of the local interpretable predictor a meaningful explanation consisting of: a decision rule, which explains the reasons of the decision; and a set of counterfactual rules, suggesting the changes in the instance's features that lead to a different outcome. Wide experiments show that LORE outperforms existing methods and baselines both in the quality of explanations and in the accuracy in mimicking the black box.
