0	OODP	10 ways to undermine an O.O. project	Object orientation has been billed as the new paradigm that will lead to better software design, higher productivity, lower maintenance costs, and improved understanding and communication. This paper is based on the author's personal experience of working with commercial development teams in commercial object oriented projects. The emerging pattern is of projects that use diluted or incomplete versions of OO, and are scoped and measured in such a way that they are unable to show any OO benefits.		Cherrill, J.

2	OODP	A basic introduction to OO concepts	Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful methodology to improve the processes of design, development, and maintenance of application software. Object-oriented computer languages such as Smalltalk and C++ are used to implement and develop software applications using the object-oriented paradigm. This article describes just what the object-oriented paradigm is, and uses simple ideas to introduce the concepts of object-oriented programming. These concepts are sometimes difficult to grasp but with perseverance and determination the OO paradigm is understandable and usable. Once a programmer understands OO, there are many worthwhile and rewarding programming discoveries to make. OOP has many features that make it perfect to add to the M programming development environment.		Anderson, R.

3	OODP	A bloat-aware design for big data applications	Over the past decade, the increasing demands on data-driven business intelligence have led to the proliferation of large-scale, dataintensive applications that often have huge amounts of data (often at terabyte or petabyte scale) to process. An object-oriented programming language such as Java is often the developer's choice for implementing such applications, primarily due to its quick development cycle and rich community resource. While the use of such languages makes programming easier, significant performance problems can often be seen - the combination of the inefficiencies inherent in a managed run-time system and the impact of the huge amount of data to be processed in the limited memory space often leads to memory bloat and performance degradation at a surprisingly early stage. This paper proposes a bloat-aware design paradigm towards the development of efficient and scalable Big Data applications in object-oriented GC enabled languages. To motivate this work, we first perform a study on the impact of several typical memory bloat patterns. These patterns are summarized from the user complaints on the mailing lists of two widely-used open-source Big Data applications. Next, we discuss our design paradigm to eliminate bloat. Using examples and real-world experience, we demonstrate that programming under this paradigm does not incur significant programming burden. We have implemented a few common data processing tasks both using this design and using the conventional object-oriented design. Our experimental results show that this new design paradigm is extremely effective in improving performance - even for the moderate-size data sets processed, we have observed 2.5x+ performance gains, and the improvement grows substantially with the size of the data set.

4	OODP	A bottom-up approach to understand functional programs	One affective way to carry out a program comprehension process is by refactoring the source code. In this paper we explore this approach in the functional programming paradigm, on Haskell programs specifically. As result, we have identified many correlations between the traditional (procedural and object-oriented) program comprehension process and the so called understanding-oriented refactorings, in the functional programming context. Besides, we have identified a catalog of refactorings used to improve program efficiency which, applied in reverse order, are valuable for program understanding purposes. Coupled to these refactorings, there is a calculational process by (means of) which we obtain a full formal description of program functionality. All together, a bottom-up program comprehension strategy in the functional setting is described.

8	OODP	A comparison of structured analysis and object oriented analysis: An experimental study	Despite the fact that object oriented paradigm is actually widely adopted for software analysis, design, and implementation, there are still a large number of companies that continue to utilize the structured approach to develop software analysis and design. The fact is that the current worldwide agreement for object orientation is not supported by enough empirical evidence on advantages and disadvantages of object orientation vs. other paradigms in different phases of the software development process. In this work we describe an empirical study focused on comparing the time required for analyzing a data management system by using both object orientation and a structural technique. We choose the approach indicated by the Rational Unified Process, and the Structured Analysis and Design Technique, as instances of object oriented and structured analysis techniques, respectively. The empirical study that we present considers both an uncontrolled and a controlled experiment with Master students. Its aim is to analyze the effects of those techniques to software analysis both for software development from scratch, and enhancement maintenance, respectively. Results show no significant difference in the time required for developing or maintaining a software application by applying those two techniques, whatever is the order of their application.

    abstract = ""Despite the fact that object oriented paradigm is actually widely adopted for software analysis, design, and implementation, there are still a large number of companies that continue to utilize the structured approach to develop software analysis and design. The fact is that the current worldwide agreement for object orientation is not supported by enough empirical evidence on advantages and disadvantages of object orientation vs. other paradigms in different phases of the software development process. In this work we describe an empirical study focused on comparing the time required for analyzing a data management system by using both object orientation and a structural technique. We choose the approach indicated by the Rational Unified Process, and the Structured Analysis and Design Technique, as instances of object oriented and structured analysis techniques, respectively. The empirical study that we present considers both an uncontrolled and a controlled experiment with Master students. Its aim is to analyze the effects of those techniques to software analysis both for software development from scratch, and enhancement maintenance, respectively. Results show no significant difference in the time required for developing or maintaining a software application by applying those two techniques, whatever is the order of their application. However we found two major tendencies regarding object orientation: 1) it is more sensitive to subjects' peculiarities, and 2) it is able to provide some reusability advantages already at the analysis level. Since such result concerns a one-hour-size enhancement maintenance, we expect significant benefits from using object orientation, in case of real-size extensions."",

12	OODP	A design pattern for service injection and composition of web services for unstructured peer-to-peer computing systems with SOA	Adaptability in software is the main fascinating concern for which today's software architects are really interested in providing the autonomic computing. Different programming paradigms have been introduced for enhancing the dynamic behavior of the programs. Few among them are the Aspect oriented programming (AOP) and Feature oriented programming (FOP) with both of them having the ability to modularize the crosscutting concerns, where the former is dependent on aspects ,advice and lateral one on the collaboration design and refinements. In order to provide remedy for the service failures that occurs at the servers of the respective service providers, there is a need to introduce the self-reconfiguration planes to be applied autonomically without the interruption of the administrator to solve the problem manually. In this paper we will Propose an Service Injection Design Pattern for Unstructured Peer-to-Peer networks, which is designed with Aspect-oriented design patterns .We propose this pattern which is an amalgamation of the Strategy Design Pattern, Worker Object Aspect-Oriented Design Pattern, and Check-List Design Pattern these can be used to design the Self-Adaptive Systems. The main concept here is that when a client requests for a complex service then Service Composition should be down to fulfill the request. With the help of strategy pattern we can choose a service that can do the task of two or more services at a single click. With the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) which is an XML file that can be requested from all the Web Services providing peers (as HTTP GET). This file contains the all the description about the service, means the input and output parameters of that service and its location details. When a client requests for a service that is not loaded currently in the memory will be injected as Aspectual Feature Module code. Here we will be using the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with Web Services in Java to Implement the Design Pattern. The pattern is described using a java-like notation for the classes and interfaces. A simple UML class and Sequence diagrams are depicted.

13	OODP	A different kind of programming languages course	"The complexity of the well-explored regions of the programming language design space has increased substantially in the last twenty-five years with the addition of a large number of object-oriented programming languages (OOPLs). This design domain was already known to be large and complex before OOPLs came on the scene, and many offerings of the standard programming languages course before that time did not even mention the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. Now that OOP has become mainstream, undergraduate programs which include a course on programming language design and implementation have responded by expanding their existing course or by jettisoning some of the alternative ideas in favor of expanded coverage of OOPLs. There are two facts, however, which must be confronted as we consider what information we would like to pass on to our students in this fascinating area of our discipline. The first is that the design space represented by OOPLs is large enough to justify a separate course, and the second is that a large number of ideas from other language paradigms appear in subsets of well-known languages for OOP. This paper presents a course in the design and implementation of programming languages that (as OOP itself did in the late eighties) turns some accepted notions ""inside out"" by proposing that the entire course be presented from the OOP point of view. Such a course has been offered by Grove City College for a decade and has matured into a very effective means of communicating essential programming language design and implementation ideas to our students.

14	OODP	A Discussion on Blockchain Software Quality Attribute Design and Tradeoffs	The blockchain design pattern has many variations and is a concept that will continue to lead many implementations in the years to come. New design and implementation patterns are frequently being announced and the choices available continue to expand. The design patterns imply tradeoffs which are reviewed. We begin by describing the components of a blockchain; network nodes, blocks and consensus in a concept. We further elaborate on the key characteristics of the various design areas that are available adding emphasis to those used in private blockchains. The individual components can be designed in different ways and imply tradeoffs between such quality attributes as performance and security or availability. We conclude with an initial tradeoff matrix that identifies the quality attributes that one should look for in designing these software systems.

15	OODP	A Distributed System to Manage Multimedia Data in a Multisensor Real Time Hydrometeorological Monitoring System	A multimedia meteorological and hydrogeological information system, based on the Client-Server paradigm, is considered, and its use in a telecommunication service for civil protection applications is described. The communication system employed is briefly reported. The system is conceived in order to collect, share and efficiently manage spatial, remote-sensed, multisensor images and ground data, spread over a network; it can provide a service to monitor hydrometeorological hazards e.g. in an operational version of STORM, and a support to manage related emergencies. An experimentation of the supported service is reported. The implemented database installation allows remote accesses for meteorologists and hydrologists by means of a multimedia graphical workstation, through the communication system, in a distributed system configuration. The conceptual model of the system is briefly reported; it is based on an Object Oriented Analysis (OOA). The model objective is to conceptualise and capture as many as possible of the space-time attributes of the environmental information managed in a real time monitoring system. In particular, the conceptualisation of remotely sensed and cartographic data is considered, as well as its management, processing and enhancement. The system provides a framework to support and integrate hydrological and meteorological applications; the presented telecommunication service is an example. This is now operating in the Arno Project, supported by the National Group for Prevention from Hydrogeological Hazards (GNDCI) of the National Council of Research (CNR) in Italy. This project aims at developing studies and experiments for the Arno River flood forecasting, through an advanced, integrated, real-time monitoring system coupled with an associated information system.

16	OODP	A dynamically reconstructible SW function layer for evolutionary robots	In the classical robot motion paradigm, robots make it difficult to respond efficiently to the dynamically variable environment such as disaster area. In order to handle such a situation that may be changed dynamically, a technology that allows a dynamic execution of data transmission and physical/logical connection between multiple robots based on scenarios is required. In this paper, we introduce evolutionary robots and its dynamically reconstructible software function layer. Proposed software function layer can be added new software functions or updated and enhance the performance on existed functions, through the robot communications.

17	OODP	A family of design patterns for flexibly configuring network services in distributed systems	This paper describes a family of design patterns that enhance the flexibility and extensibility of communication software by permitting network services to evolve independently of the strategies used to passively initialize the services. The paper makes three contributions to the study and development of configurable distributed systems. First, it identifies five orthogonal dimensions of passive service initialization: service advertisement, endpoint listening, service handler creation, passive connection establishment, and service handler activation. Second the paper illustrates how a family of design patterns have been used to build a communication software framework that supports flexible configuration of different strategies for each of these five dimensions. Third, the paper demonstrates how design patterns and frameworks are being used successfully to develop configurable large-scale production distributed systems.	design patterns; configurable distributed systems; object-oriented communication frameworks; design patterns;  configurable distributed systems;  object-oriented communication frameworks	Schmidt, DC	THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONFIGURABLE DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS	https://doi.org/10.1109/CDS.1996.509354		124-135	"""@inproceedings{WOS:A1996BF69A00015,

In this paper, a methodology for data association using an Oriented Bounding Box based object representation is presented. A laser scanner sensor is used for objects perception. A data association algorithm for coalescing objects is described. The algorithm is based on the Nearest Neighbours principle enriched by an Inter-Rays uncertainty paradigm and a Fixed Size assumption, which are introduced to improve the tracking process in terms of objects size and center position estimation.

19	OODP	A Formal Approach to Checking Consistency in Software Refactoring	In software development, refactoring is a process that improves the system internal structure without altering its external behavior. Applying design patterns, which are common reusable solutions of several kinds of problems is widely adopted. This technique, however, raises a challenging issue that after applying design patterns the software system may not preserve some certain behavioral properties. This paper proposes a new approach to checking consistency between original software system and its evolution at both design and implementation phases. First, we formalize elements of software designs and programs. Methods, based on these formalizations, are proposed for verifying the design and implementation of the system. Finally, the paper presents a case study of Adaptive Road Traffic Control system to illustrate the proposed approach in detail.

20	OODP	A formal aspect-oriented method to model and analyse secure service composition	Service-oriented computing (SOC) is becoming a prominent paradigm for creating value-added enterprise applications by composing web services. However, this flexibility comes along with new security risks. In this paper, Petri nets are used to precisely describe the different components of service composition, such as service, component, the basic relation between components, etc. The dynamic matching strategy of service composition is proposed, aspect orientation is used to weave it into the base net, which includes evaluation concern, authorisation concern and failure processing concern, the weaving mechanism dynamically integrates these schemas into a secure aspect model. Based on this, the operation semantics and related theories of Petri nets help prove the effectiveness and feasibility of proposed method, the enforcement algorithm is also given. An example explains the modelling process of service composition, and a series of experiments are done to explain that the use of aspects for service composition is more efficient than conventional techniques.

21	OODP	A formal model of object-oriented design and GoF design patterns	Particularly in object-oriented design methods, design patterns are becoming increasingly popular as a way of identifying and abstracting the key aspects of commonly occurring design structures. The abstractness of the patterns means that they can be applied in many different domains, which makes them a valuable basis for reusable object-oriented design and hence for helping designers achieve more effective results. However, the standard literature on patterns invariably describes them informally, generally using natural language together with some sort of graphical notation, which makes it very difficult to give any meaningful certification that the patterns have been applied consistently and correctly in a design. In this paper, we describe a formal model of object-oriented design and design patterns which can be used to demonstrate that a particular design conforms to a given pattern, and we illustrate using an example how this can be done. The formality of the model can also help to resolve ambiguities and incompletenesses in the informal descriptions of the patterns.

22	OODP	A framework for developing component-based applications with temporal analysis capabilities	Reactive system design requires the integration of structural and behavioral requirements with temporal ones (along with V&V activities) to describe the application architecture. This paper describes an implementation framework for component-based applications that provides developers with great control over application concurrency (number of threads and their characteristics), the computational load assigned to them, and allows the temporal analysis of the applications developed with the framework. The paper presents an improved version of a framework previously developed, putting it in the context of a global Model-Driven Software Development approach for developing, analyzing and generating code for reactive applications.

23	OODP	A framework for extensible and adaptable system software	Supporting separation of concerns in the design of operating systems can provide a number of benefits such as reusability, extensibility and reconfigurability. However, in order to maximize these benefits, such a support is difficult to accomplish. Some aspects in operating systems such as synchronization, scheduling, and fault tolerance cut across the basic functionalities of the system. In every layer these aspects might need to be modified. By separating the different aspects of operating system in every layer, we can provide a better generic design model of operating systems. Aspect-Oriented Programming is a paradigm proposal that aims at separating components and aspects from the early stages of the software life cycle, and combining them together at the implementation phase. However, aspect-oriented software engineering can be better supported if the underlying operating system is built based on this approach as well. Treating aspects, components, and layers in a two dimensional model is not adequate. Two-dimensional models lead to inflexibility, limit the possibilities for reuse, and make it hard to understand and modify. In this paper we discuss a language-neutral aspect-oriented design framework that can simplify system design by expressing it at a higher level of abstraction. Our work concentrates on how to maximize separation of aspects, components, and layers from each other. Our goal is to achieve a better design model for operating systems in terms of extensibility and adaptability.

24	OODP	A framework for integrating software design patterns with game design framework	Object oriented design patterns (DP) are meant to provide a common structure for solving common software development problems. Applying those patterns is expected to improve the software systems maintainability, comprehensibility, and provide a common language for developers to understand and effectively communicate. However, this was not always the case, where some studies have shown that using design patterns may lead to a system harder to maintain and understand and more error prone; as compared to same systems without the use of design patterns. This variation is referred to the features of the system on hand, and the experience of the developers who are capable to know what design patterns to use and when. Considering the video game development, the use of software design pattern is still at low scale, and still; there is no recipe on what and when to use design patterns. In the meantime, there are different game design frameworks that define different aspects which need to be considered when developing a game. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates some creational and behavioral DP, with a specific game design framework. In this way, we claim that the developers will have some hints on what DP to use with the main game aspects. This framework is suitable for games which can be developed after the first course of game design, regardless of the game engine used for development. The framework can be extended with more DP, for larger scale and more sophisticated game.

25	OODP	A framework for supporting views in component oriented information systems	The Component Oriented Design of Information Systems is spreading. After being used for gaining in reusability at the architectural level, components are nowadays applied at the business logic level. We focus here on the design of multiple functional views in such information systems, specially within the EJB framework. Traditionally, in the database context, this problem is solved by the notion of 'view-schemas' applied to a database schema. We present a composition-oriented approach grounded on the splitting of entities according to views requirements. Two original design patterns are formulated and capture the main issues of the approach. The first one is concerned with the management of the split component and its conceptual identity. The second offers a solution for relationships among such components. Finally, we apply these patterns to the EJB framework. This framework improves evolution and traceability of views.

Furthermore, on the basis of data management paradigm over hybrid peer-to-peer (P2P) network combined with the IMS architecture, we consider binding a database capability for the community management with each super-peer on the network.

28	OODP	A fuzzy object relational approach to flexible real estate trade	The object-relational database management systems (ORDBMS) appear due to the common acceptance of the object oriented paradigm and its integration with relational databases, combining the powerful modelling capabilities of the object oriented model and the robustness of relational model. ORDBMSs user defined types allow to create a framework for fuzzy information handling. This paper proposes to use that fuzzy framework to improve computer assisted search-offering processes, focusing on the real estate trading area.

29	OODP	Cascading dialog modeling with UsiXML	This paper discusses multi-level dialog specifications for user interfaces Of multi-target interactive systems and it proposes a step-wise method that combines a transformational approach for model-to-model derivation and an interactive editing of dialog models for tailoring the derived models. This method provides a synthesis of existing solutions for dialog modeling using a XML-based User Interface Description Language, UsiXML, along with StateWebCharts notation for expressing the dialog at a high level of abstraction. Our aim is to push forward the design and reuse of dialog specifications throughout several levels of abstraction ranging from task and domain models until the final user interface thanks to a mechanism based on cascading style sheets. In this way, it is expected that the dialog properties are not only inherited from one level to another but also are made much more reusable than in the past.	cascading style sheet; dialog modeling; multi-target user interfaces; StateWebCharts; user interface description language; UsiXML; cascading style sheet;  dialog modeling;  multi-target user interfaces;  StateWebCharts;  user interface description language;  UsiXML	Winckler, Marco; Vanderdonckt, Jean; Stanciulescu, Adrian; Trindade, Francisco	CBMI'2007 - 2007 International Workshop on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing, Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMI.2007.385404	Auber, D.(2003)Graph drawing software, chapter Tulip - A Huge Graph Visualization Framework.Cited 241 times.Verlag; Auber, D., Delest, M., Domenger, J.P., Ferraro, P., Strandh, R.EVAT : Environment for visualization and analysis of trees(2003)IEEE Symposition on Information Visualisation Contest, volume, pp. 124-126.Cited 6 times.www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/iv03contest; D.

30	OODP	A Lease Based Hybrid Design Pattern for Proper-Temporal-Embedding of Wireless CPS Interlocking	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate discrete-Time computing and continuous-Time physical-world entities, which are often wirelessly interlinked. The use of wireless safety-critical CPS requires safety guarantees despite communication faults. This paper focuses on one important set of such safety rules: Proper-Temporal-Embedding (PTE), where distributed CPS entities must enter/leave risky states according to properly nested temporal pattern and certain duration spacing. Our solution introduces hybrid automata to formally describe and analyze CPS design patterns. We propose a novel leasing based design pattern, along with closed-form configuration constraints, to guarantee PTE safety rules under arbitrary wireless communication faults. We propose a formal procedure to transform the design pattern hybrid automata into specific wireless CPS designs. This procedure can effectively isolate physical world parameters from affecting the PTE safety of the resultant specific designs. We conduct two wireless CPS case studies, one on medicine and the other on control, to show that the resulted system is safe against communication failures. We also compare our approach with a polling based approach. Both approaches support PTE under arbitrary communication failures. The polling approach performs better under severely adverse wireless medium conditions; while ours performs better under benign or moderately adverse wireless medium conditions.

31	OODP	A lightweight component-based development approach for enterprise applications	Component-based development (CBD) is considered as a promising way to improve software productivity and quality by reusing some pre-existing components. However, in real practice, such a paradigm is not fully exploited by many enterprise application (EA) software companies because of the much needed effort and cost. For addressing these problems, we propose a lightweight approach that divides an EA into hierarchical component elements and maps them to a CBD environment based on Eclipse. Such an approach takes most characteristics of EAs into account and the modularity and reusability of the components are assured by OSGi. A real case study focusing on refactoring legacy software to a component-based one with our approach is illustrated its validity.

32	OODP	A lightweight framework for data acquisition and quality monitoring in power system	In power system, data acquisition plays an increasing important role in the field of modern power quality monitoring system. However, data communication expanding range of protocols, increasing the signal type, growing the supervisory instruments has become the major problem. In this paper, we present a power data acquisition and quality monitoring framework (F-PDAQM) that is a software framework which abstracts the most common attributes and behaviors in power quality monitoring system. F-PDAQM was developed in object-oriented with some design patterns, and implemented by using C++. It can achieve data visualization of power system via combining virtualization technology and power quality monitoring system. A significant contribution which F-PDAQM brings is that the problem of multiple communication protocols match with a variety of communication channel is solved. A voltage prediction component is provided to realize the voltage quality prediction. In addition, we propose a new concept of soft data acquisition and provide interfaces which are conducive to realize different algorithms. Soft data acquisition is an extremely important method to assure data integrity. F-PDAQM is composed of four layers. This four-layer architecture is designed for extensibility and reusability so that more complex power system problems can be tackled within the framework. It is complementary and compatible of the international standard of the power system-IEC 61850. The research in this paper has been applied to a data acquisition and supervisory system for a substation which demonstrates the validity and flexibility of the framework.

33	OODP	A lightweight key management protocol for secure communication in smart grids	With the introduction of smart grid technology as the next-generation power grid, monitoring and control of the power systems are facing new challenges. Smart grid technology increases the reliability, security, and efficiency of electrical grids. However, its strong dependencies on digital communication technology increase the system's vulnerabilities to different types of cyber-attacks. The existing communication paradigm suffers from security weaknesses in the IEC 62351 standard, data transfer latency in Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sample Values (SV) protocols. This paper proposes a secure communication protocol based on hash and private key to overcome the security weaknesses while facilitating the key agreement at the right time. IEC 61850 is not safe on its own, even with dedicated communication. Therefore, for the security of the standard, IEC 62351 is used.

34	OODP	A logic programming framework for possibilistic argumentation: Formalization and logical properties	In the last decade defeasible argumentation frameworks have evolved to become a sound setting to formalize commonsense, qualitative reasoning. The logic programming paradigm has shown to be particularly useful for developing different argument-based frameworks on the basis of different variants of logic programming which incorporate defeasible rules. Most of such frameworks, however, are unable to deal with both explicit uncertainty and vague knowledge, as defeasibility is directly encoded in the object language. This paper presents possibilistic defeasible logic programming (P-DeLP), a new logic programming language which combines features from argumentation theory and logic programming, incorporating as well the treatment of possibilistic uncertainty. Such features are formalized on the basis of PGL, a possibilistic logic based on Godel fuzzy logic. One of the applications of P-DeLP is providing an intelligent agent with non-monotonic, argumentative inference capabilities. In this paper we also provide a better understanding of such capabilities by defining two non-monotonic operators which model the expansion of a given program by adding new weighed facts associated with argument conclusions and warranted literals, respectively. Different logical properties for the proposed operators are studied.

35	OODP	A macro system with class objects for the Java language	This paper presents OpenJava, which is a macro system the authors have developed for Java. Writing a number of typical macros in object-oriented programming is difficult with traditional macro systems designed for non object-oriented languages. This is because the primary language constructs of object-oriented languages such as Java are not procedures or functions but they are classes and methods. This paper first points out this problem and then shows how OpenJava is addressed to the problem. One of the drawbacks of traditional macro systems is that syntax trees are used for representing source programs. For OpenJava, therefore, class objects were chosen instead of syntax trees. As high-level macros for an object-oriented language, this paper shows a few macros in OpenJava which help programming with design patterns.		Tatsubori, M. (1); Chiba, S.; Itano, K.

36	OODP	A measurement based comparative evaluation of effectiveness of object-oriented versus conventional procedural programming techniques and languages	Many assumptions have been made about positive effects of the object-oriented paradigm on software quality. It has been also widely assumed that the object-oriented programming technique is more powerful than the conventional procedural programming technique and object-based languages provide abstraction far better than procedural languages. However, in reality little or no empirical evidence has been given to support these assumptions. Therefore, there is a desperate need for a quantitative-based comparative evaluation of merits of object-oriented versus conventional procedural program design methods and languages. This paper reports on a pioneer work in this direction. The paper describes the results of the application of well-established software metrics on data-collection through controlled experimentation, where forty subjects developed program samples in Java and C languages for the solution of the same set of problems via object-oriented and procedural structured program design methods respectively. Three important aspects of program quality known as program difficulty, effort to comprehend implementation of the algorithm and level of languages have been measured from Java and C programs using well established and recognized software science metrics.

38	OODP	A model for the migration to object-oriented software development with special emphasis on improvement of acceptance	Object oriented technology has been established as an important new paradigm in software development. Thus, many organizations involved in any kind of software production plan to migrate to object oriented technology or have already started this process. Besides several successful migrations, many failures occur. In order to reduce the risk of failure during the migration process, we developed a migration model based on an empirical study. The application of this model leads to a better understanding of the migration process and supports its planning, designing and implementation, putting special emphasis on improvement of acceptance. The theoretical foundations of our migration model come from technology management, organizational research (i.e. change management, and organizational roles), as well as existing approaches and models for this kind of migration. Our migration model consists of three main parts: the migration process model, the definition of organizational roles, and the use of acceptance strategies such as information and communication, participation, and further education. The main results concerning the rise of acceptance strategies, based on the results of the empirical study, are presented.

39	OODP	A model-based repository for open source service and component integration	Open source is a software development paradigm that has seen a huge rise in recent years. It reduces IT costs and time to market, while increasing security and reliability. However, the difficulty in integrating developments from different communities and stakeholders prevents this model from reaching its full potential. This is mainly due to the challenge of determining and locating the correct dependencies for a given software artifact. To solve this problem we propose the development of an extensible software component repository based upon models. This repository should be capable of solving the dependencies between several components and work with already existing repositories to access the needed artifacts transparently. This repository will also be easily expandable, enabling the creation of modules that support new kinds of dependencies or other existing repository technologies. The proposed solution will work with OSGi components and use OSGi itself.

41	OODP	A multimedia communication framework for the selection of collaborative partners in global manufacturing	Nowadays multimedia technology can develop all kinds of signals (i.e. sound, text, pictures, moving graphics, videos, etc) that can be transported from one place to another via a computer network. There is no doubt that multimedia technology can offer the global manufacturing enterprise a very powerful means to communicate with worldwide manufacturing partners. However, the utilization of multimedia communication does not always improve the effectiveness of collaboration among the manufacturing partners. It is, therefore, very important for a global manufacturing enterprise to ensure that the developed multimedia communication system can provide a tangible improvement to global manufacturing, rather than further complicating it. This paper proposes a collaborative framework to deal with multimedia communications, which can simplify the enterprise's collaboration in an effective manner. The focus of this framework is on a key area, that of the global manufacturing partner's selection. The proposed framework is generated from the CIM-OSA (Open System Architecture for CIM) approach and modelling. It is constructed and operated using the principles of communication, collaboration and coordination for global manufacturing, in conjunction with an object-oriented paradigm. The paper will particularly address information access difficulties, framework modelling and the collaboration of information flow.		Ho, John K. L.; Fung, Ricky; Chu, Louis; Tam, W.M.

    abstract = ""Nowadays multimedia technology can develop all kinds of signals (i.e. sound, text, pictures, moving graphics, videos, etc) that can be transported from one place to another via a computer network. There is no doubt that multimedia technology can offer the global manufacturing enterprise a very powerful means to communicate with worldwide manufacturing partners. However, the utilization of multimedia communication does not always improve the effectiveness of collaboration among the manufacturing partners. It is, therefore, very important for a global manufacturing enterprise to ensure that the developed multimedia communication system can provide a tangible improvement to global manufacturing, rather than further complicating it. This paper proposes a collaborative framework to deal with multimedia communications, which can simplify the enterprise's collaboration in an effective manner. The focus of this framework is on a key area, that of the global manufacturing partner's selection. The proposed framework is generated from the CIM-OSA (Open System Architecture for CIM) approach and modelling. It is constructed and operated using the principles of communication, collaboration and coordination for global manufacturing, in conjunction with an object-oriented paradigm. The paper will particularly address information access difficulties, framework modelling and the collaboration of information flow. (c) 2000 Taylor \& Francis Ltd."",

42	OODP	A multiple phases approach for design patterns recovery based on structural and method signature features	Design patterns describe both structure, behavior of classes and their relationships. They can improve software documentation, speed up the development process and enable large-scale reuse of software architectures. This article presents a multiple levels detection approach (MLDA) to recover design pattern instances from Java source code. MLDA is able to recover design pattern instances based on a generated class level representation of a subject system. Specifically, MLDA presents what is the so-called Structural Search Model (SSM) which incrementally builds the structure of each design pattern based on the generated source code model. Moreover, MLDA uses a rule-based approach to match the method signatures of the candidate design instances to that of the subject system. As the experiment results illustrate, MLDA is able to recover 23 design patterns with reasonable detection accuracy.

43	OODP	A nonhuman primate's perception of object relations:: experiments on cottontop tamarins, <i>Saguinus oedipus</i>	Objects in nature often have spatial and functional relationships with other objects. For example, fruit may be connected to tree branches, bushes sometimes function as landmarks for home, and stones are functionally associated with nuts when they are used to crack the nuts open. Although animals may use the spatial and functional relationships between specific objects, it is important for ethologists interested in cognitive mechanisms to ask whether animals understand the spatial relationship between objects in a more general and abstract way. In this experiment, we ask whether a small New World monkey, the cottontop tamarin, is capable of perceiving the abstract relational concept of `connectedness'. Using a traditional operant paradigm, subjects were required to press one button to images with connected objects, and another button to images with separated objects. In Phase I of the experiment, subjects received training with only one connected and one separated image. Following training, probe images were presented in which features such as colour, texture and shape were systematically manipulated to determine which features were more important in stimulus classification. Accuracies and reaction times of responses were recorded. On the basis of their performance, the tamarins appeared to recognize that changes in the colour or texture of two objects plays no functional role in determining whether such objects are connected or separated. In contrast, changes in the shape and distance between two objects does play an important functional role, and the tamarins appeared to be sensitive to such changes. In Phase 2, subjects received training with a larger set of images. After this training, classification accuracy remained significantly above chance with most probes, suggesting that the tamarins had acquired a more general connectedness concept. In Phase 3, novel images were presented. Classification accuracy was significantly above chance for many of the novel images. Overall, results suggest that tamarins perceive spatial relationships between stimuli to some extent and can classify images based in part on their spatial relationship. Other recent experiments have shown that cottontop tamarins respond to spatial relationships even better than in the current experiment when they have to act directly on the objects. The difference between these results suggests that tamarins perceive the spatial relationships between objects more readily in the context of an ecologically valid problem. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

45	OODP	A pattern based modelling for self-organizing multi-agent systems with event-B	Self-Organizing Multi-Agent Systems (SO-MAS) are defined as a set of autonomous entities called agents interacting together in order to achieve a given task. Generally, the development process of these systems is based on the bottom-up approach which focuses on the design of the entities individual behavior. The main question arising when developing SO-MAS is how to insure that the designed entities, when interacting together, will give rise to the desired behavior? Our proposition to deal with this question is to use formal methods. We propose a correct by construction method for systematic design of SO-MAS based on the use of design patterns and formal stepwise refinements. Our work gives guidelines to assist the designer when developing the individual behavior of the entities and prove its correctness at the early stages of the design process. The method is illustrated with the foraging ants' case study.

We propose a correct by construction method for systematic design of SO-MAS based on the use of design patterns and formal stepwise refinements. Our work gives guidelines to assist the designer when developing the individual behavior of the entities and prove its correctness at the early stages of the design process. The method is illustrated with the foraging ants' case study. Copyright (c) 2014 SCITEPRESS."",

48	OODP	A proper prime minister: Appointive responsibility in Japanese cabinet scandals	Cabinet scandals and minister resignations happen frequently in Japan. In recent years, political opponents and the mass media have approached such cases as occasions for pursuit of the prime minister's 'appointive responsibility'. Based on comprehensive source material since 1989 but focusing particularly on 2006-2012, this paper introduces appointive responsibility as an object of critical analysis. Emphasizing that the notion has distinct ideological implications, I pinpoint the rhetorical techniques and strategic rationale underlying appointive responsibility and show that the phenomenon operates in two logically opposed forms. The first form follows a causality principle and presents the prime minister as inappropriately ignorant. The second one operates according to a representative logic and revolves around inappropriate knowledge. Outlining and problematizing both forms, the paper analytically unravels key aspects of a new paradigm of executive leadership and responsibility in Japanese political discourse. The paper contributes to a better qualitative understanding of responsibility constructs in recent Japanese politics and delivers a focused critical examination of appointive responsibility as a key rhetorical vehicle for tapping into frustrated public expectations of political leadership.

49	OODP	A qualitative analysis of software security patterns	Software security, which has attracted the interest of the industrial and research community during the last years, aims at preventing security problems by building software without the so-called security holes. One way to achieve this goal is to apply specific patterns in software architecture. In the same way that the well-known design patterns for building well-structured software have been defined, a new kind of patterns called security patterns have emerged. These patterns enable us to incorporate a level of security already at the design phase of a software system. There exists no strict set of rules that can be followed in order to develop secure software. However, a number of guidelines have already appeared in the literature. Furthermore, the key problems in building secure software and major threat categories for a software system have been identified. An attempt to evaluate known security patterns based on how well they follow each principle, how well they encounter with possible problems in building secure software and for which of the threat categories they do take care of, is performed in this paper.

    abstract = ""Software security, which has attracted the interest of the industrial and research community during the last years, aims at preventing security problems by building software without the so-called security holes. One way to achieve this goal is to apply specific patterns in software architecture. In the same way that the well-known design patterns for building well-structured software have been defined, a new kind of patterns called security patterns have emerged. These patterns enable us to incorporate a level of security already at the design phase of a software system. There exists no strict set of rules that can be followed in order to develop secure software. However, a number of guidelines have already appeared in the literature. Furthermore, the key problems in building secure software and major threat categories for a software system have been identified. An attempt to evaluate known security patterns based on how well they follow each principle, how well they encounter with possible problems in building secure software and for which of the threat categories they do take care of, is performed in this paper. Thirteen security patterns were evaluated based on these three sets of criteria. The ability of some of these patterns to enhance the security of the design of a software system is also examined by an illustrative example of fortifying a published design. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As the paradigm continues to increase in popularity, a systematic and objective approach to verify the design of a pattern is increasingly important.

We propose a validation approach to help pattern developers check if a design pattern is well-designed. In addition, a quantitative method is proposed to measure the effectiveness of the quality improvement of a design pattern that pattern users can determine which design patterns are applicable to meet their functional and quality requirements.

53	OODP	A Reusable Agent Design Pattern with Flexibility and Extensibility	Intelligent agent-based systems are regarded as the promising technology in bridging the gap between the physical world and cyber-applications. In spite of the rising demands for reusable information systems; current designs are still insufficient in providing efficient reusable mechanisms for system design. One of the major problems hinders the development of information reuse in most traditional systems is the lack of the autonomous character among system modules or subsystems. The emergence of agent technology is able to solve the problem plaguing many traditional systems. Existing agent design models create an agent as a sole system with built-in domain-specific capabilities. However, this design pattern causes several problems while matching and updating agents. capabilities due to the built-in design pattern in these models decreases agents. extensibility, flexibility and reusability. In this paper we introduce a novel design for agent-based systems, which is able to provide an efficient design pattern for improving the reusability, extensibility and flexibility of agent design. The novel agent capability design offers an open and flexible structure; and implements several practical algorithms that can improve the system performance. An experimental program based on several practical cases has been developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed design. The empirical results reveal the efficiency of the new agent design pattern.

54	OODP	A reuse based approach for requirements engineering	"The interest in conceptual and software reuse is no longer to show time and cost savings, quality improvements, etc.; it is now essential, in requirements engineering (RE) in particular, because of the frequent evolution of requirements. However, its practical application requires a transformation of working methods: (1) the constitution of a library of components, and (2) analysis guided by the reuse of components. Among the various vectors of components, design patterns are a privileged solution. The development of our ""Requirements Diagnosis"" pattern language illustrates the transmission of know-how in requirements analysis. Its application shows how the analyst is guided, in a flexible way, to identify the problems and assets of a legacy system in order to analyse the finalities of the organization and to identify its requirements."

    abstract = {The interest in conceptual and software reuse is no longer to show time and cost savings, quality improvements, etc.; it is now essential, in requirements engineering (RE) in particular, because of the frequent evolution of requirements. However, its practical application requires a transformation of working methods: (1) the constitution of a library of components, and (2) analysis guided by the reuse of components. Among the various vectors of components, design patterns are a privileged solution. The development of our ""Requirements Diagnosis"" pattern language illustrates the transmission of know-how in requirements analysis. Its application shows how the analyst is guided, in a flexible way, to identify the problems and assets of a legacy system in order to analyse the finalities of the organization and to identify its requirements.

55	OODP	A revised perspective on documentation practices in the modern organisation	There are a number of reasons for the use of various methodologies in the development of systems (Broady, Walters & Hartley (1994)), notably a reduction in user dissatisfaction and more effective communication between systems developers and users. These reduce the risk of a new system being presented to its users as a fait accompli. The use of an appropriate modelling paradigm can produce a better end product, improved consistency and the likelihood of improved user acceptance. Formal methodologies may be appropriate for more technical systems where fewer human factors are involved; however, they may be too mechanistic to be effective in detailed, day-to-day organization of developers activities. Traditional methodologies can still be valuable in IS development projects in order to maintain an image of control or to provide symbolic status (Nandhakumar & Avison (1999)). Hard methods, such as structured and object-oriented approaches, (Bocij et al. (1999)) focus on the Computer Based Information Systems as a technical artifact, which must satisfy a set of well-defined user requirements. According to Chekland & Howell (1998), organisational change and improvement can only be successful when the organisational actors are engaged in that change. The IS is increasingly being viewed as a social artifact, and researchers such as Stapleton (2001) and Dewar et al. (2003) highlight the need for a revised perspective on ISD to deal with this development. Coady (2003) showed that, while there is a body of work which is concerned with the social aspects of creating a technical artifact, very little work has investigated documenting the IS as a social artifact. This paper presents an empirical study; which identifies those practices that academia suggests are the current industrial standards, compares the perceived standards to current practice in the organisations involved in the research and develops conclusions suggesting better industrial practice.

This framework allows the development of secure distributed applications on existing operating systems that do not support distributed security. The design aims at making the authentication and access control mechanisms transparent to the application level and supporting access control policies specified using the concept of the management domain. This concept has been developed as a means of specifying policies in terms of groups of objects. The description focuses on how the Access Control List paradigm is combined with pseudo capabilities which are used as hints to improve the time efficiency of the access control decision mechanism.

57	OODP	A service-oriented approach to security - Concepts and issues	Various mechanisms for authentication and access control have been developed over time. Operating systems and DBMS implement such mechanisms and support quite rich access control models. A major limitation, however, of such mechanisms is that they are not extensible; thus whenever an application domain requires more sophisticated access controls or authentication, the applications must include logics for such controls. Such an approach leads to increased costs in application development and maintenance. For these reasons, models and mechanisms apt to separate those functions have emerged, also fostered by XML and Web services. At the same time, the need to drive the behaviour of security through clearly stated and machine-processable policies has fostered the development of various policy models and policy management mechanisms. A policy-based approach enhances flexibility, and reduces the application development costs. Changes to the access control or authentication requirements simply entail modifying the policies, without requiring changes to the applications. It is thus clear that an important approach to the problem of security is represented by the development of policy-based security services providing all functions for security management relevant to applications. Such an approach is particularly promising for applications organized according to the Service Oriented (SOA) paradigm. In this paper we discuss basic concepts of such an approach to security and we present a reference architectural framework. We discuss three relevant classes of security services, namely digital identity management services, authentication services, access control services, and outline research directions for each such class.

58	OODP	A software architecture for effective document identifier reassignment	This works presents a software solution for enhancing inverted file compression based on the reassignment of document identifiers. We introduce different techniques recently presented in the Information Retrieval forums to address this problem. We give further details on how it is possible to perform the reassignment efficiently by applying a dimensionality reduction to the original inverted file and on the evaluation results obtained with this technique.

59	OODP	A software transformation framework for quality-driven object-oriented re-engineering	In re-engineering object-oriented legacy code, it is frequently useful to introduce a design pattern in order to improve specific non-functional requirements (e.g., maintainability enhancement). This paper presents a methodology for the development of a quality-driven re-engineering framework for object-oriented systems. First, a catalogue of design motifs (primitive design pattern transformations) is presented. Then, the transformations for the design patterns in the GoF book are defined as a composition of these primitive transformations. Non-functional requirements for the migrant system can be encoded using soft-goal interdependency graphs and can be associated with design pattern transformations that are applied for the migration of an object-oriented legacy system.

61	OODP	A sparse coding approach for local-to-global 3D shape description	The definition of reliable shape descriptors is an essential topic for 3D object retrieval. In general, two main approaches are considered: global, and local. Global approaches are effective in describing the whole object, while local ones are more suitable to characterize small parts of the shape. Recently some strategies to combine these two approaches have been proposed which are mainly concentrated to the so-called bag of words paradigm. With this paper we address this problem and propose an alternative strategy that goes beyond the bag of word approach. In particular, a sparse coding technique is exploited for the 3D domain: a set of local shape descriptors are collected from the shape, and then a dictionary is trained as generative model. In this fashion the dictionary is used as global shape descriptor for shape retrieval purposes. Several experiments are performed on standard databases in order to evaluate the proposed method in challenging situations like the case of 'SHREC 2011: robustness benchmark' where strong shape transformations are included, and the case of 'SHREC 2007: partial matching track' where composite models are considered in the query phase. A drastic improvement of the proposed method is observed by showing that sparse coding approach is particularly suitable for local-to-global description and outperforms other approaches such as the bag of words.

62	OODP	A Study of Database Connection Pool in Microservice Architecture	The growing number of the Internet presents a higher requirement for backend application systems to be designed to handle thousands of user traffic concurrently. Microservice architecture is also in a rising trend which allows each service to scale horizontally by its throughput, and load helps scale the system efficiently without waste of resources like in the traditional monolithic application system. Among the many strategies to optimize delivery, the database connection pool helps backend systems to access databases efficiently by reusing database connections, thus eliminating the computationally expensive need to open and close connections with new requests. Additionally, database connection pools can help improve applications' connection reliability. This paper aims to determine the most suitable maximum amount of database connections in a microservice setting, where multiple instances of the service are used for scalability and high availability purposes of the system. To tackle the scalability issue and achieve the high availability of our services, we propose running multiple instances of each of our services in production, especially for services that we anticipate would be hit the most during runtime. This allows load balancing of request load between multiple instances and having backup instances to serve HTTP requests when one of the instances is down. The result obtained in this experiment shows that five database connections give the best result in microservice settings as described in our methodology.	backend application system;; database connection pool;; Microservice	Sobri, Nur Ayuni Nor; Abas, Mohamad Aqib Haqmi; Yassin, Ihsan Mohd; Ali, Megat Syahirul Amin Megat; Md Tahir, Nooritawati; Zabidi, Azlee; Rizman, Zairi Ismael	International Journal on Informatics Visualization	https://doi.org/10.30630/joiv.6.2-2.1094	Sampaio, A.R., Kadiyala, H., Hu, B., Steinbacher, J., Erwin, T., Rosa, N., Beschastnikh, I., (...), Rubin, J.; Gan, Y., Zhang, Y., Cheng, D., Shetty, A., Rathi, P., Katarki, N., Bruno, A., (...), Delimitrou, C.; Peddoju, V.

    abstract = ""The growing number of the Internet presents a higher requirement for backend application systems to be designed to handle thousands of user traffic concurrently. Microservice architecture is also in a rising trend which allows each service to scale horizontally by its throughput, and load helps scale the system efficiently without waste of resources like in the traditional monolithic application system. Among the many strategies to optimize delivery, the database connection pool helps backend systems to access databases efficiently by reusing database connections, thus eliminating the computationally expensive need to open and close connections with new requests. Additionally, database connection pools can help improve applications' connection reliability. This paper aims to determine the most suitable maximum amount of database connections in a microservice setting, where multiple instances of the service are used for scalability and high availability purposes of the system. To tackle the scalability issue and achieve the high availability of our services, we propose running multiple instances of each of our services in production, especially for services that we anticipate would be hit the most during runtime. This allows load balancing of request load between multiple instances and having backup instances to serve HTTP requests when one of the instances is down. The result obtained in this experiment shows that five database connections give the best result in microservice settings as described in our methodology. (c) 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

63	OODP	A study on audit information systems improved model based on public internal audit paradigm shift	In the recent work environment, any firm or organization can't guarantee the achievement of its strategic goals, that is, its success without utilizing IT well, so the IT became the object of main attention, and the reliance on the IT gets more intensified in all business fields. Therefore, each firm and public institute take enormous efforts for setting their internal audit systems appropriate for the recent business environment. Especially as the Public Audit Act began to take in effect from 2010, its raised the necessity to develop a new internal audit administration meeting a more advanced internal audit body's role and its status as well as the changes in the administration different from the past administration. Reflecting the past, the existing internal audit activities have done around the post-exposure approaching to the known risks or a kind of fragmentary checkup around samples. Besides, the existing internal audits have focused on pointing out the organization's problems and controlling them. So the organization being audited did not fully accept the internal audit results and there were also some aspects not meeting the internal customer's needs. Therefore this study aimed to propose an improved model of audit information system supporting the recent audit trends (enhancing the efficiency of work process and consulting) in order to draw out a more strategic improvement plan after analyzing the status quo of public firms' internal audits and their problems through the review of existing studies and literature about the theme.

65	OODP	A study on users' willingness to accept mobility as a service based on UTAUT model	MaaS has received highly anticipated from the field of transportation theory and practice in recent years. Many Chinese cities have also proposed plans to build MaaS systems and have begun to implement them. As a new type of travel service paradigm, user recognition, acceptance, and continued use are prerequisites for the survival and development of MaaS. Therefore, accurately identifying the key variables that affect user acceptance and grasping the user's requirements are important support to ensure the MaaS has been applying successfully. Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology model (UTAUT), this study establishes an analysis framework of MaaS acceptance and intention. A small town with a very common use of cars in the suburbs of Shanghai was selected as the survey object, and the potential uses and requirements of MaaS for 314 households and 600 residents were collected. This study proposes five important strategies for the promotion and application of MaaS: 1. Strengthen publicity and promote the MaaS concept to be more easily understood and accepted. 2. Improve convenience in the manual and avoid cumbersome operations; 3. Grasp the users' curiosity and the early adopters, and cultivate the approved user base. 4. Focus on improving user experience, maintaining MaaS reputation, rewarding users for sharing register invitations. 5. Strengthening the protection of user information and service stability of MaaS guarantee to eliminate user concerns. At the same time, different services can be launched for different groups.

67	OODP	A super-oscillatory lens optical microscope for subwavelength imaging	The past decade has seen an intensive effort to achieve optical imaging resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Apart from the Pendry-Veselago negative index superlens, implementation of which in optics faces challenges of losses and as yet unattainable fabrication finesse, other super-resolution approaches necessitate the lens either to be in the near proximity of the object or manufactured on it, or work only for a narrow class of samples, such as intensely luminescent or sparse objects. Here we report a new super-resolution microscope for optical imaging that beats the diffraction limit of conventional instruments and the recently demonstrated near-field optical superlens and hyperlens. This non-invasive subwavelength imaging paradigm uses a binary amplitude mask for direct focusing of laser light into a subwavelength spot in the post-evanescent field by precisely tailoring the interference of a large number of beams diffracted from a nanostructured mask. The new technology, which-in principle-has no physical limits on resolution, could be universally used for imaging at any wavelength and does not depend on the luminescence of the object, which can be tens of micrometres away from the mask. It has been implemented as a straightforward modification of a conventional microscope showing resolution better than l/6.

68	OODP	A Survey of Automatic Code Generation from Natural Language	Many researchers have carried out studies related to programming languages since the beginning of computer science. Besides programming with traditional programming languages (i.e., procedural, object-oriented, functional programming language, etc.), a new paradigm of programming is being carried out. It is programming with natural language. By programming with natural language, we expect that it will free our expressiveness in contrast to programming languages which have strong constraints in syntax. This paper surveys the approaches that generate source code automatically from a natural language description. We also categorize the approaches by their forms of input and output. Finally, we analyze the current trend of approaches and suggest the future direction of this research domain to improve automatic code generation with natural language. From the analysis, we state that researchers should work on customizing language models in the domain of source code and explore better representations of source code such as embedding techniques and pre-trained models which have been proved to work well on natural language processing tasks.

69	OODP	A survey report of enhancements to the visitor software design pattern	The Visitor pattern is a behavioral software design pattern where different objects represent an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure. Despite the benefits of the Visitor pattern, its rigid structure has limitations. Owing to the Visitor pattern's usefulness and importance to software design, many researchers have extended and modified the original Visitor pattern to overcome its limitations. Researchers have even replaced the Visitor pattern with more refined design patterns (e.g., Reflective Visitor pattern, Java Walkabout Class, and Dynamic Dispatcher) that bear minimal resemblance to the original Visitor pattern's structure while retaining its major advantages (e.g., ability to add new operations to an object structure without changing the classes of objects, localizing related behavior, and accumulating state). This article therefore provides a comprehensive survey of the Visitor pattern for software practitioners. Within the survey, we focus on major enhancements that have been made to the original Visitor pattern to overcome its limitations. On the basis of our survey results, we found that variations of the Visitor pattern can be separated into two categories: extended Visitor patterns where the original Visitor pattern structure stays intact and alternative Visitor patterns where the structure of the original Visitor pattern is altered.

Researchers have even replaced the Visitor pattern with more refined design patterns (e.g., Reflective Visitor pattern, Java Walkabout Class, and Dynamic Dispatcher) that bear minimal resemblance to the original Visitor pattern's structure while retaining its major advantages (e.g., ability to add new operations to an object structure without changing the classes of objects, localizing related behavior, and accumulating state). This article therefore provides a comprehensive survey of the Visitor pattern for software practitioners. Within the survey, we focus on major enhancements that have been made to the original Visitor pattern to overcome its limitations. On the basis of our survey results, we found that variations of the Visitor pattern can be separated into two categories: extended Visitor patterns where the original Visitor pattern structure stays intact and alternative Visitor patterns where the structure of the original Visitor pattern is altered.

70	OODP	A Systematic Methodology for Developing Component Frameworks	Component-based software engineering (CBSE) is being accepted as an effective paradigm for building software systems with reusable components. Product line software engineering (PLSE) is an approach that utilizes CBSE principles to support the economic development of several applications in a domain. Hence, the components should conform to relevant domain standards and they must at least provide common functionality of the domain. Moreover, micro-level variability within commonality should also be modeled in components so that a product member-specific business logic or requirement can be supported through component tailoring or customization. Therefore, the degree of commonality and customizability determines the range of component applicability. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to identify and model commonality and variability (C&V) and present a methodology to reason about the identified C&V model. With the proposed process and guidelines, components in a product line can better support a larger set of family applications.

72	OODP	A tree-based classification of high and low error-severity modules using the CK metrics	Few research papers have addressed classifying modules into several levels of error severity using tree-based techniques. This research aims to provide a method of error classification at two levels: classifying classes into either erroneous or not-erroneous using OO metrics (binary category), and classifying classes into two severities of errors (Low or High) using OO metrics (multi-category). This paper analyzes an open-source system-Eclipse IDE-which was developed using the object-oriented paradigm. The Chidamber and Kemerer metrics are used to build a classifier of erroneous modules. While using the binary category classifier gives good results, we found that using the multi-category classifier produces a better classification performance.

73	OODP	A two phase approach to design pattern recovery	In this paper we present a two phase approach to the recovery of structural design pattern. In the first phase, the design pattern instances are identified at a course-grained level by considering the design structure only and using a visual language parsing technique. Then, the identified candidate patterns are validated by a fine-grained source code analysis phase. The latter phase is an enhancement of a previous approach developed by the authors aiming at improving the results of precision and time performances. The retrieval effectiveness of the approach is assessed by applying the recovery technique on four software systems.

74	OODP	A two-dimensional separation of concerns for compiler construction	During language evolution, compiler construction is usually performed along two dimensions: defining new abstract syntax tree (AST) classes, or adding new operations. In order to facilitate such changes, two software design patterns (i.e., the inheritance pattern and the visitor pattern) are widely used to help modularize the language constructs. However, as each design pattern is only suitable for one dimension of extension, neither of these two patterns can independently fulfill the evolution needs during the compiler construction process. In this paper, we analyze two dimensions of concerns in compiler construction and develop a paradigm allowing compiler evolution across these two dimensions using both object-orientation and aspect-orientation. Moreover, this approach provides an ability to perform pattern transformation based on pluggable aspects. A simple implementation of an expression language and its possible extension is demonstrated using Java and AspectJ.

In this paper, we analyze two dimensions of concerns in compiler construction and develop a paradigm allowing compiler evolution across these two dimensions using both object-orientation and aspect-orientation. Moreover, this approach provides an ability to perform pattern transformation based on pluggable aspects. A simple implementation of an expression language and its possible extension is demonstrated using Java and AspectJ. Copyright 2005 ACM."",

75	OODP	A unified accretion-ejection paradigm for black hole X-ray binaries: IV. Replication of the 2010-2011 activity cycle of GX 339-4	Context. Transient X-ray binaries (XrB) exhibit very different spectral shapes during their evolution. In luminosity-color diagrams, their behavior in X-rays forms q-shaped cycles that remain unexplained. In Paper I, we proposed a framework where the innermost regions of the accretion disk evolve as a response to variations imposed in the outer regions. These variations lead not only to modifications of the inner disk accretion rate ain, but also to the evolution of the transition radius rJ between two disk regions. The outermost region is a standard accretion disk (SAD), whereas the innermost region is a jet-emitting disk (JED) where all the disk angular momentum is carried away vertically by two self-confined jets. Aims. In the previous papers of this series, it has been shown that such a JED-SAD disk configuration could reproduce the typical spectral (radio and X-rays) properties of the five canonical XrB states. The aim of this paper is now to replicate all X-ray spectra and radio emission observed during the 2010-2011 outburst of the archetypal object GX 339-4. Methods. We used the two-Temperature plasma code presented in two previous papers (Papers II and III) and designed an automatic ad hoc fitting procedure that for any given date calculates the required disk parameters (ain,rJ) that fit the observed X-ray spectrum best. We used X-ray data in the 3-40 keV (RXTE/PCA) spread over 438 days of the outburst, together with 35 radio observations at 9 GHz (ATCA) dispersed within the same cycle. Results. We obtain the time distributions of ain(t) and rJ(t) that uniquely reproduce the X-ray luminosity and the spectral shape of the whole cycle. In the classical self-Absorbed jet synchrotron emission model, the JED-SAD configuration also reproduces the radio properties very satisfactorily, in particular, the switch-off and-on events and the radio-X-ray correlation. Although the model is simplistic and some parts of the evolution still need to be refined, this is to our knowledge the first time that an outburst cycle is reproduced with such a high level of detail. Conclusions. Within the JED-SAD framework, radio and X-rays are so intimately linked that radio emission can be used to constrain the underlying disk configuration, in particular, during faint hard states. If this result is confirmed using other outbursts from GX 339-4 or other X-ray binaries, then radio could be indeed used as another means to indirectly probe disk physics.

We show that BP principles can be instrumental in addressing common software engineering issues such as separation of graphical representation from logic and the handling of inter-object scenarios. We also show that a BP infrastructure can be implemented with limited run-time resources in a single-threaded environment using coroutines.

79	OODP	Ada in concert	In a concert, it is truly marvelous how a diverse group of musicians playing an assortment of musical instruments come together to produce beautiful music. A point that is frequently made by those familiar with the new Ada standard, referred to here as Ada(95), is how the features in Ada(95) come together to enhance the software development process. This paper contains several examples that illustrate how the new features in Ada(95) dramatically improve the correlation between the design of a solution and its eventual implementation at the source code level when compared to Ada(83).The example, binary tree packaging, illustrates the design and implementation of recursive data structures. A data structure is recursive if the structure contains one or more substructures of the type being defined. As a result, recursive data structures lend themselves to processing with recursive algorithms. Lists, binary trees, and n-ary trees are examples of data structures that may be defined recursively. The example presented here is a package that implements binary trees using a recursive paradigm. The paper compares an Ada 83 solution with a solution using Ada 95. The paper focuses on how Ada 95 allows us to create a solution that more closely mirrors the specifications for the recursive data structure with improved time, space, and coding efficiency over an Ada 83 implementation. In a sense, this paper provides one illustration of how the '95 standard improves Ada.		Beidler, Jack	Ada Lett.	https://doi.org/10.1145/261374.261384		57-66	"""@article{10.1145/261374.261384,

    abstract = ""In a concert, it is truly marvelous how a diverse group of musicians playing an assortment of musical instruments come together to produce beautiful music. A point that is frequently made by those familiar with the new Ada standard, referred to here as Ada(95), is how the features in Ada(95) come together to enhance the software development process. This paper contains several examples that illustrate how the new features in Ada(95) dramatically improve the correlation between the design of a solution and its eventual implementation at the source code level when compared to Ada(83).The example, binary tree packaging, illustrates the design and implementation of recursive data structures. A data structure is recursive if the structure contains one or more substructures of the type being defined. As a result, recursive data structures lend themselves to processing with recursive algorithms. Lists, binary trees, and n-ary trees are examples of data structures that may be defined recursively. The example presented here is a package that implements binary trees using a recursive paradigm. The paper compares an Ada 83 solution with a solution using Ada 95. The paper focuses on how Ada 95 allows us to create a solution that more closely mirrors the specifications for the recursive data structure with improved time, space, and coding efficiency over an Ada 83 implementation. In a sense, this paper provides one illustration of how the '95 standard improves Ada."",

80	OODP	Adaptation of a refactoring DSL for the object-oriented paradigm	Many development environments offer refactorings to improve specific properties of software, but we have no guarantees that these transformations indeed preserve the functionality of the source code they are applied on. An existing domain-specific language, currently specialized for Erlang, makes it possible to formalize automatically verifiable refactorings via instantiating predefined transformation schemes with conditional term rewrite rules. We present a proposal for adapting this language from the functional to the object-oriented programming paradigm, using Java in place of Erlang as a representative. The behavior-preserving property of discussed refactorings is characterized with a multilayered definition of equivalence for Java programs, including the conformity relation of class hierarchies. Based on the decomposition of a complex refactoring rule, we show how new transformation schemes can be identified, along with modifications and extensions of the description language required to accommodate them. Finally, we formally define the chosen base refactoring as a composition of scheme instances.

81	OODP	Adapting transformations to metamodel changes via external transformation composition	Evolution is inherent to software systemsbecause of the rapid improvement of technologies and business logic. As a software development paradigm, model driven engineering (MDE) is also affected by this problem. More concretely, being metamodels the cornerstone of MDE, their evolution impacts the rest of software artefacts involved in a development process, i.e., models and transformations. The influence over models has been tackled and partially solved in previous works. This paper focuses on the impact over transformations. We propose an approach to adapt transformations by means of external transformation composition. That is, we chain impacted transformations to particular adaptation transformations which deal with either refactoring/destruction changes or construction changes. Our approach semi-automatically generates such transformations by using the AtlanMod matching language, a DSL to define model matching strategies. To provide with a proof of concept for our proposal, we adapt transformations written in terms of object-relational database metamodels when such metamodels evolve in time.

82	OODP	Adaptive agent integration in designing object-based multiagent system	The aim of the paper is to design a multiagent system in an object oriented paradigm where agents jointly contribute to solve a problem based on their expertise and the information available in a blackboard system. The problem knowledge base is represented by If-Then rules and a scheduler integrates the rules with the agents act as objects. The problem has been formalized into a tree structure. A tree traversal algorithm has been presented in the paper that determines the scope of contribution of the agents for solving the problem. If the required agent is not available or its contribution is not satisfactory, the system with the help of Kohonen network identifies the winner agent for replacement resulting overall better system performance.

83	OODP	Adaptive context-sensitive analysis for JavaScript	Context sensitivity is a technique to improve program analysis precision by distinguishing between function calls. A specific context-sensitive analysis is usually designed to accommodate the programming paradigm of a particular programming language. JavaScript features both the objectoriented and functional programming paradigms. Our empirical study suggests that there is no single context-sensitive analysis that always produces precise results for JavaScript applications. This observation motivated us to design an adaptive analysis, selecting a context-sensitive analysis from multiple choices for each function. Our two-staged adaptive context-sensitive analysis first extracts function characteristics from an inexpensive points-to analysis and then chooses a specialized context-sensitive analysis per function based on the heuristics. The experimental results show that our adaptive analysis achieved more precise results than any single contextsensitive analysis for several JavaScript programs in the benchmarks.

84	OODP	Adaptive surface reconstruction from non uniform point sets	In this paper, a proposed algorithm for surface reconstruction from uniform or non-uniform point sets is introduced. The points are typically acquired with multiple range scans of any 3D object. The proposed algorithm follows the advancing front paradigm to build the reconstructed surface employing a variable radius moving ball that expands and shrinks continuously based on the sampling density. Starting with a user-specified initial radius, this initial ball may touch three points without containing any other point forming a seed triangle. For any edge, another point is found to form a ball with minimum radius generating another triangle. The process continues until generating all possible edges. The algorithm is theoretically proved under certain sampling criteria on the input data set. The proposed algorithm was applied on different datasets and compared favorably with the most eminent techniques. The key issues for comparisons were the reconstructed surface quality, the memory usage and the execution time. The present algorithm bested others in treating non uniform samples, samples with sharp edges and samples with small holes.

86	OODP	Advantages and disadvantages of unique representation patterns	There's a rule in computer programming that b_x001C_applications expand to fill the memory availableb_x001D_. Despite decreases in the cost of memory, for some applications memory remains a scarce resource. This article proposes a method for decreasing memory usage for applications that dynamically create large objects in memory, many of which are, or become, identical. This method follows the general structure of design patterns as given by E. Gamma et al. (1995). The unique representation pattern is similar to the singleton pattern. The intention of the singleton pattern is to ensure that a class only has one instance, and to provide a global point of access to it. The intention of the unique representation pattern is to ensure that there exists in memory only one copy of each unique object of a class, and to provide access to it from multiple clients. An additional benefit is that the processing time for comparing large objects for equality is reduced.		White, R.G.	C++ Report			28-35							2					SIGS Publications, USA	
87	OODP	Agent-oriented modelling: Software versus the world	Agent orientation is currently pursued primarily as a software paradigm. Software with characteristics such as autonomy, sociality, reactivity and proactivity, and communicative and cooperative abilities are expected to offer greater functionality and higher quality, in comparison to earlier paradigms such as object orientation. Agent models and languages are thus intended as abstractions of computational behaviour, eventually to be realized in software programs. However, for the successful application of any software technology, the software system must be understood and analyzed in the context of its environment in the world. This paper argues for a notion of agent suitable for modelling the strategic relationships among agents in the world, so that users and stakeholders can reason about the implications of alternate technology solutions and social structures, thus to better decide on solutions that address their strategic interests and needs. The discussion draws on recent work in requirements engineering and agent-oriented methodologies. A small example from telemedicine is used to illustrate. B) Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.

88	OODP	UNIFIED MODELING LANGUAGE AND OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN PATTERN BASED COMPUTER-AIDED WELDING FIXTURE DESIGN SYSTEM	Most of previous computer aided fixture design(CAFD) research has mainly concentrated on machining fixtures rather than welding fixtures, and how to face the challenges such as dynamic requirements, expansion, maintenance and management in the development of complicated computer aided welding fixture design(CAWFD) software system has received much less attention. Application of Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Object-oriented Design Pattern (OODP) for developing CAWFD software system has been discussed in this paper. CAWFD system functions like design phases, workflow and design subtasks in each design phase are introduced. How to employ UML fundamental elements such as use case diagram, class diagram and component diagram to model the CAWFD system has been demonstrated. Multiple- tier architecture of CAWFD and its benefits are also presented. OODP has been certified to be an effective and efficient method especially for class diagram creation and refinement which is the key point during system analysis and design. Due to the complexity of CAWFD, the class diagram for CAWFD is classified as conceptual class diagram and detailed class diagram. How to use Model-View-Control (M-V-C) design pattern in conceptual class diagram and the benefits of M-V-C application are discussed. For detailed class diagram, the techniques of applying Command, Observer, Factory and Template patterns to realize code reuse are articulated. As a result, the extension, reusability and maintainability of CAWFD system can be obtained by applying UML and OODP.

89	OODP	Algebraic database migration to object technology	Relational database systems represent the current standard technology for implementing database applications. Now that the object-oriented paradigm becomes more and more mature in all phases of the software engineering process, object-oriented DBMS are seriously considered for the seamless integration of object-oriented applications and data persistence. However, when reengineering existing applications or constructing new ones on top of relational databases, a large semantic gap between the new object model and the legacy databaseb_x0019_s model must be bridged. We propose database migration to resolve this mismatch: the relational schema is transformed into an object-oriented one and the relational data is migrated to an object-oriented database. Existing approaches for migration do not exploit the full potential of the object-oriented paradigm so that the resulting object-oriented schema still 'looks rather relational' and retains the drawbacks and weaknesses of the relational schema. We propose a redesign environment which allows to transform relational schemas into adequate object-oriented ones. Schemas and transformation rules are expressed in terms of a new data model, called semi object types (SOT). We also propose a formal foundation for SOT and transformation rules. This formalization makes it possible to automatically generate the data migration process. B) Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.		Behm, Andreas (1); Geppert, Andreas (1); Dittrich, Klaus R.

90	OODP	Algorithmic Debugging of Java Programs	In this paper we propose applying the ideas of declarative debugging to the object-oriented language Java as an alternative to traditional trace debuggers used in imperative languages. The declarative debugger builds a suitable computation tree containing information about method invocations occurred during a wrong computation. The tree is then navigated, asking the user questions in order to compare the intended semantics of each method with its actual behavior until a wrong method is found out. The technique has been implemented in an available prototype. We comment the several new issues that arise when using this debugging technique, traditionally applied to declarative languages, to a completely different paradigm and propose several possible improvements and lines of future work.

93	OODP	An abstract intermediate representation in compilation systems	The design of an intermediate representation is critical to the portability of a compiler and the efficiency of code generation. In order to increase the reusability of compiler components, and to simplify the development process of compilers, the paper presents an abstract intermediate representation (AIR) that provides a concise notation for describing the abstract syntax of programming languages and the inner data structures of compilers. AIR integrates algebraic data types into the object-oriented paradigm and thus makes it have stronger expressive power, flexibility, and extensibility. AIR separates the abstract descriptions from the concrete implementation. This makes it easier to be implemented in different high-level languages and thus improves the interoperatibility of compiler components.

    abstract = ""The design of an intermediate representation is critical to the portability of a compiler and the efficiency of code generation. In order to increase the reusability of compiler components, and to simplify the development process of compilers, the paper presents an abstract intermediate representation (AIR) that provides a concise notation for describing the abstract syntax of programming languages and the inner data structures of compilers. AIR integrates algebraic data types into the object-oriented paradigm and thus makes it have stronger expressive power, flexibility, and extensibility. AIR separates the abstract descriptions from the concrete implementation. This makes it easier to be implemented in different high-level languages and thus improves the interoperatibility of compiler components."",

94	OODP	An abstract method linearization for detecting source code plagiarism in object-oriented environment	Despite the fact that plagiarizing source code is a trivial task for most CS students, detecting such unethical behavior requires a considerable amount of effort. Thus, several plagiarism detection systems were developed to handle such issue. This paper extends Karnalim's work, a low-level approach for detecting Java source code plagiarism, by incorporating abstract method linearization. Such extension is incorporated to enhance the accuracy of low-level approach in term of detecting plagiarism in object-oriented environment. According to our evaluation, which was conducted based on 23 design-pattern source code pairs, our extended low-level approach is more effective than state-of-the-art and Karnalim's approach. On the one hand, when compared to state-of-the-art approach, our approach can generate less coincidental similarities and provide more accurate result. On the other hand, when compared to Karnalim's approach, our approach, at some extent, can generate higher similarity when simple abstract method invocation is incorporated.

95	OODP	An access and information flow control paradigm for secure information sharing in service-based systems	Cloud now provides a wide range of services hosted by different providers from different domains. These services can be composed together dynamically to realize important tasks. In a composite service, information may flow from one service to subsequent services from different domains. Such information flow, if not properly controlled, may cause undesired leakage of critical data. Existing works on access control for web service do not consider the information flow problem in composite services. Existing information flow control (IFC) techniques is not flexible and cannot work with domain-specific information flow control policies. Existing works on access control for web service do not consider the information flow problem in composite services. Existing information flow control (IFC) techniques are not flexible and cannot work with domain-specific information flow control policies. In this paper, we define the WS-AIFC infrastructure for enforcing access and information flow control. The major goal of WS-AIFC is to provide a new IFC mechanism that can allow each domain to define their own IFC policies while WS-AIFC is capable of preventing undesired information leakage (IFC policy violation) among benign, semi-honest service domains. The main idea in WS-AIFC is to derive and record the dependency list for each data object. The system, upon receiving an access request to a critical data object, not only validates the conventional access control policy for the access, but also extracts the data and the corresponding domains in the dependency list and consults these domains to validate their IFC policies for the indirect access. In summary, WS-AIFC empowers individual domains to control how their information flows and achieves enhanced security for service based systems.

98	OODP	An approach for verification in service-oriented computing	Verification is an essential engineering activity to enhance software quality by checking the conformance of an artifact to its given specification, typically in criteria of completeness and correctness. Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) incorporates a new computing paradigm of publish-discover- compose, in which service providers publish services, service dynamically consumers discover right service and aggregate them into a service composition. Since this paradigm is not presented in conventional computing paradigm such as object-oriented paradigm, conventional verification methods do not effectively apply to SOC. Rather, verification in SOC requires a new conceptual framework on verification criteria, verification paths, and verification methods. In this paper, we present a formal framework for verifying various artifacts of service-oriented development. We first present a generic SOC process model and its key artifacts.

    abstract = ""Verification is an essential engineering activity to enhance software quality by checking the conformance of an artifact to its given specification, typically in criteria of completeness and correctness. Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) incorporates a new computing paradigm of publish-discover- compose, in which service providers publish services, service dynamically consumers discover right service and aggregate them into a service composition. Since this paradigm is not presented in conventional computing paradigm such as object-oriented paradigm, conventional verification methods do not effectively apply to SOC. Rather, verification in SOC requires a new conceptual framework on verification criteria, verification paths, and verification methods. In this paper, we present a formal framework for verifying various artifacts of service-oriented development. We first present a generic SOC process model and its key artifacts. And, we provide representations of key artifacts, and propose methods for checking completeness and correctness of key artifacts. We present a case study to show the applicability of the verification framework in practice. (c) 2008 IEEE."",

100	OODP	An architecture for defeasible-reasoning-based cooperative distributed planning	Cooperation plays a fundamental role in distributed planning, in which a team of distributed intelligent agents with diverse preferences, abilities and beliefs must cooperate during the planning process to achieve a set of common goals. This paper presents a MultiAgent Planning and Argumentation (MAPA) architecture based on a multiagent partial order planning paradigm using argumentation for communicating agents. Agents use an argumentation-based defeasible reasoning to support their own beliefs and refute the beliefs of the others according to their knowledge. In MAPA, actions and arguments may be proposed by different agents to enforce some goal, if their conditions are known to apply and arguments are not defeated by other arguments applying. In order to plan for these goals, agents start a stepwise dialogue consisting of exchanges of plan proposals to satisfy this open goal, and they evaluate each plan proposal according to the arguments put forward for or against it. After this, an agreement must be reached in order to select the next plan to be refined.

101	OODP	An architecture for emergent semantics	Emergent Semantics is a new paradigm for inferring semantic meaning from implicit feedback by a sufficiently large number of users of an object retrieval system. In this paper, we introduce a universal architecture for emergent semantics using a central repository within a multi-user environment, based on solid linguistic theories. Based on this architecture, we have implemented an information retrieval system supporting term queries on standard information retrieval corpora. Contrary to existing query refinement strategies, feedback on the retrieval results is incorporated directly into the actual document representations improving future retrievals. An evaluation yields higher precision values at the standard recall levels and thus demonstrates the effectiveness of the emergent semantics approach for typical information retrieval problems.

102	OODP	An Aspect Oriented Framework for Scientific Component development	Aspect-Oriented Programming enables developers to capture in separated aspect modules concerns that are spread over different components in a system. This paper is an attempt to apply this paradigm to High Performance Computing. Besides achieving the usual advantages of improved modularity, more reusable code that is easier to develop and maintain, we pursue to improve efficiency by means of dynamic changes of aspects at runtime. We present an Aspect-Oriented Framework where Scientific Components and Aspects are first-order entities (components) which interaction is established by means of what we have called Aspect Connectors. As an example, we focus on the communication aspect, which encapsulates the communication scheme among the set of components that set up a system. The expressiveness and suitability of the approach are shown by means of an application example.

This paper is an attempt to apply this paradigm to High Performance Computing. Besides achieving the usual advantages of improved modularity, more reusable code that is easier to develop and maintain, we pursue to improve efficiency by means of dynamic changes of aspects at runtime. We present an Aspect-Oriented Framework where Scientific Components and Aspects are first-order entities (components) which interaction is established by means of what we have called Aspect Connectors. As an example, we focus on the communication aspect, which encapsulates the communication scheme among the set of components that set up a system. The expressiveness and suitability of the approach are shown by means of an application example."",

103	OODP	An aspectual feature module based service injection design pattern for unstructured peer-to-peer computing systems	Adaptability in software is the main fascinating concern for which today's software architects are really interested in providing the autonomic computing. Different programming paradigms have been introduced for enhancing the dynamic behavior of the programs. Few among them are the Aspect oriented programming (AOP) and Feature oriented programming (FOP) with both of them having the ability to modularize the crosscutting concerns, where the former is dependent on aspects, advice and later one on the collaboration design and refinements. In this paper we will propose an Service Injection design pattern for Unstructured Peer-to-Peer networks, which is designed with Aspect-oriented design patterns .We propose this pattern which is an amalgamation of the Worker Object Pattern, Case-Based Reasoning Pattern and Reactor Pattern that can be used to design the Self-Adaptive Systems. Every peer node in the network provides services to many clients, so in order to handle each client request they must be executed in a separate thread which is the functionality provided by the Worker Object Aspect-Oriented Design Pattern. Then after a service request is accepted by a peer server, it will assign the task of serving the request to client with the help of Reactor Pattern. The reactor pattern handles service requests that are delivered concurrently to a peer server by one or more clients. Case-base reasoning pattern is used for composition of services that are provided at different peer servers with the help of JUDDI to serve clients complex service requests. We'll study the amalgamation of the Feature-oriented and Aspect-oriented software development methodology and its usage in developing a design pattern for peer-to-peer networks. So with the help of Aspectual Feature Module technique, we can introduce a new service into the peer system without disturbing the current running code in the server at run-time.

104	OODP	An assessment of design patterns' influence on a java-based e-commerce application	Design patterns, acting as recurring solutions to common problems, offer significant benefits such as avoiding unnecessary complexity, and promoting code reuse, maintainability and extensibility. This paper describes how four not technology-specific or language-specific design patterns (Front Controller, Model View Controller, Transfer Object and Service to Worker) can be applied to one typical e-commerce application developed using Java EE platform. The first goal is to evaluate the improvement of design properties after the implementation of each design pattern using software metrics. Another goal is to assess the influence of design patterns on the maintainability of the e-commerce application under study by examining the evolution of software metrics when performing certain extensions. The results indicate that the application of patterns positively influences design properties such as coupling, complexity and messaging implying a possible improvement in high-level quality attributes such as flexibility, extensibility and reusability.

The paper presents an empirical study to understand whether there are roles that are more change-prone than others and whether there are changes that are more likely to occur to certain roles. The study relies on data extracted from the source code repositories of three different systems (JHotDraw, Xerces, and Eclipse-JDT) and from 12 design patterns.

106	OODP	An Empirical Study on Code Comprehension: Data Context Interaction Compared to Classical Object Oriented	Source code comprehension affects software development - especially its maintenance - where code reading is one of the most time-consuming activities. A programming language, together with the programming paradigm it supports, is a strong factor that profoundly impacts how programmers comprehend code. We conducted a human-subject controlled experiment to evaluate comprehension of code written using the Data Context Interaction (DCI) paradigm relative to code written with commonly used Object-Oriented (OO) programming. We used a new research-level language called Trygve which implements DCI concepts, and Java, a pervasive OO language in the industry. DCI revisits lost roots of the OO paradigm to address problems that are inherent to Java and most other contemporary OO languages. We observed correctness, time consumption, and locality of reference during reading comprehension tasks. We present a method which relies on the Eigenvector Centrality metric from Social Network Analysis to study the locality of reference in programmers by inspecting their sequencing of reading language element declarations and their permanence time in the code. Results indicate that DCI code in Trygve supports more comprehensible code regarding correctness and improves the locality of reference, reducing context switching during the software discovery process. Regarding reading time consumption, we found no statistically significant differences between both approaches.

Results indicate that DCI code in Trygve supports more comprehensible code regarding correctness and improves the locality of reference, reducing context switching during the software discovery process. Regarding reading time consumption, we found no statistically significant differences between both approaches. (c) 2017 IEEE."",

107	OODP	An empirical study on program comprehension with reactive programming	Starting from the first investigations with strictly functional languages, reactive programming has been proposed as the programming paradigm for reactive applications. The advantages of designs based on this style over designs based on the Observer design pattern have been studied for a long time. Over the years, researchers have enriched reactive languages with more powerful abstractions, embedded these abstractions into mainstream languages - including object-oriented languages - and applied reactive programming to several domains, like GUIs, animations, Web applications, robotics, and sensor networks. However, an important assumption behind this line of research - That, beside other advantages, reactive programming makes a wide class of otherwise cumbersome applications more comprehensible - has never been evaluated. In this paper, we present the design and the results of the first empirical study that evaluates the effect of reactive programming on comprehensibility compared to the traditional object-oriented style with the Observer design pattern. Results confirm the conjecture that comprehensibility is enhanced by reactive programming. In the experiment, the reactive programming group significantly outperforms the other group.

108	OODP	An evaluation of aspect-oriented programming for java-based real-time systems development	Some concerns, such as debugging or logging functionality, cannot be captured cleanly, and are often tangled and scattered throughout the code base. These concerns are called crosscutting concerns. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a paradigm that enables developers to capture crosscutting concerns in separate aspect modules. The use of aspects has been shown to improve understandability and maintainability of systems. It has been shown that real-time concerns, such as memory management and thread scheduling, are crosscutting concerns [5, 6, 9, 11]. However it is unclear whether encapsulating these concerns provides benefits. We were interested in determining whether using AOP to encapsulate real-time crosscutting concerns afforded benefits in system properties such as understandability and maintainability. This paper presents research comparing the system properties of two systems: a real-time sentient traffic simulator and its Aspect-Oriented equivalent. An evaluation of AOP is presented indicating both benefits and drawbacks with this approach.

109	OODP	A Lateral Thinking Framework for Semantic Modelling of Emergencies in Smart Cities	Manual definition of models for emergency management scenarios is a demanding activity due to the huge number of different situations to be considered. It requires knowledge related to the crisis and emergency domains, to the context (e.g., a specific city and its current regulations) and to modelling techniques. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem according to a lateral thinking perspective and, following this line, we present a framework supporting automatic creation of conceptual models concerning emergency management scenarios by means of semantic techniques. In particular, this framework relies on an ontology and on a set of semantic rules to manage, respectively, the domain and contextual knowledge, and on the design patterns approach to support the modelling activity. A software experimentation of the framework based on SPARQL and applied to emergency scenarios in smart cities is proposed to demonstrate the viability of the approach.

110	OODP	An evolution model for software modularity assessment	The value of software design modularity largely lies in the ability to accommodate potential changes. Each modularization technique, such as aspect-oriented programming and object-oriented design patterns, provides one way to let some part of a system change independently of all other parts. A modularization technique benefits a design if the potential changes to the design can be well encapsulated by the technique. In general, questions in software evolution, such as which modularization technique is better and whether it is worthwhile to refactor, should be evaluated against potential changes. In this paper, we present a decision-tree-based framework to generally assess design modularization in terms of its changeability. In this framework, we formalize design evolution questions as decision problems, model software designs and potential changes using augmented constraint networks (ACNs), and represent design modular structure before and after envisioned changes using design structure matrices (DSMs) derived from ACNs. We formalize change impacts using an evolution vector to precisely capture well-known informal design principles. As a preliminary evaluation, we use this model to compare the aspect-oriented and object-oriented observer pattern in terms of their ability to accommodate envisioned changes. The results confirm previous published results, but in formal and quantitative ways.

112	OODP	An experiment on a new programming paradigm	In the development of any technology there is always a tendency to lose sight of the basic problems that stimulated its introduction. There is very little quantitative research regarding the question whether object-oriented programming really improves productivity. Many assume that object-oriented programming is more productive than traditional structured programming. The assumption lacks concrete empirical data that support the belief. In the previous paper, we introduced the principle of an alternative programming paradigm [1]. This paradigm, called the separation principle, separates the declaration of data structures from program executable instructions.

    abstract = ""In the development of any technology there is always a tendency to lose sight of the basic problems that stimulated its introduction. There is very little quantitative research regarding the question whether object-oriented programming really improves productivity. Many assume that object-oriented programming is more productive than traditional structured programming. The assumption lacks concrete empirical data that support the belief. In the previous paper, we introduced the principle of an alternative programming paradigm [1]. This paradigm, called the separation principle, separates the declaration of data structures from program executable instructions. In this paper we present the results of our empirical studies by comparing the understandability of an OOP program versus a corresponding version written using the separation principle.

113	OODP	An extensible state machine pattern for interactive applications	The state design pattern is the standard object-oriented programming idiom for implementing the state machine logic of interactive applications. While this pattern provides a number of advantages, it does not easily support the creation of extended state machines in subclasses. We describe the extensible state design pattern, which augments the traditional state pattern with a few additional constraints that allow subclasses to easily add both new states and new events. Further, we observe that delimited continuations, a well-known construct from functional programming languages, supports state refinement in subclasses as well as the modular expression of control flow in the presence of interaction. We illustrate our pattern in the context of Java, leveraging its generics to obviate the need for dynamic typecasts and employing a small library that implements delimited continuations.

115	OODP	Incremental project plan: Introducing cleanroom method and object-oriented development method	Introducing new technologies into a software development process or project often produces both good and bad effects. If it is well planned, it will improve both productivity and quality. In this paper, we present an incremental development process planning approach (IDPA) which uses the idea of technical-dependency-based assessment of the project planning for a small and stable development team shifting slowly but steady to a new software paradigm that fits the traditional development process. The project plan was a well-connected set of incremental fragments of improvements with the introduction of new technologies or methods to the previous plans. IDPA is a method of assessing each technology or method to be decomposed and scheduled according to the technical dependency at the time of introduction. We also present a case study applying this idea to a real development project, in which object-oriented technology and the cleanroom method were introduced, and present the results of its evaluation.

117	OODP	An Intensive MVC Design Pattern Based on ASP.NET	Many experts would agree that, had it not been for the synthesis of active networks, the emulation of robots might never have occurred. After years of intuitive research into extreme programming, we confirm the study of Intensive MVC design pattern, which embodies the unfortunate principles of e-voting technology. In our research, we confirm that even though redundancy and hierarchical databases can interfere to answer this obstacle, the foremost Intensive MVC design pattern Based on ASP. NET for the improvement of the producer-consumer problem is complete.		Lei Gao (1)	Proceedings of the 2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications (ICCEA 2010)	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEA.2010.139		679-82							2					IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, USA	
118	OODP	An object model for general-purpose aspect languages	Aspect-oriented programming supports a separate treatment of different concerns in software development on one hand, and on the other it provides 'weaving' technologies for knitting together such individual concerns in software systems. Since the aspect-oriented approach is an extension of the classical OO-paradigm it requires an enhancement of well-known language constructs on the meta level. Although some general-purpose aspect languages (GPAL) are available, no commonly accepted object model has yet been proposed. Consequently a common terminology is still not available, substantially hindering the spread of good and useful concepts. This paper proposes an object model, which represents the foundation of the GPAL Sally. We compare our model with respect to AspectJ which is by far the most popular and well-established aspect language and, therefore used by a wide community.		Hanenberg, S. (1); Bachmendo, B.

119	OODP	Object-based information retrieval model: Toward the structural construction of thesauri	In this paper, we propose an information retrieval model, where the object-oriented paradigm is applied to the construction of thesauri and the interpretation of user queries. This model provides a mechanism to assist domain experts in constructing thesauri; it determines a considerable part of relationship degrees between term objects by inheritance, and supplies domain experts with information available from a thesaurus being constructed. It enables domain experts to incrementally construct thesaurus as well, since the automatically determined degree of relationships can be refined whenever a more sophisticated thesaurus is needed. It may minimize domain expert's burden caused from exhaustive specification of individual relationships. All the relationships between term objects of our thesaurus (called object-based thesaurus) are represented in terms of two levels: concept level and instance level. The former defines the relationships between concepts, whereas the latter specifies the relationships between instances. We also propose a new query evaluation mechanism to exploit the thesaurus when interpreting the intent of user queries.

120	OODP	An object-oriented analysis and design of management functions for Distributed Access Node Systems	Object-oriented technology promotes a better understanding of requirements and results in more modifiable and maintainable applications providing other benefits such as reusability, extensibility, robustness, reliability and scalability. In this paper, we present the object-oriented application framework for efficient system analysis and design. The software framework we presented comprises the application framework classes and the design pattern as a framework of the software architecture. The application framework classes provide a set of application foundation class that can support easy design and implementation of the application software. The design pattern can be used as the architectural framework by providing unified design concept and principle. In this paper, we present the application framework classes for DANS (Distributed Access Node System) management and describe the system analysis and design based on the framework classes. And we also propose the Actor-Reactor pattern to provide efficient and reusable software architecture for the distributed and multithreaded environment.

121	OODP	A pattern language for designing e-business architecture	The pattern language for e-business provides a holistic support for developing software architectures for the e-business domain. The pattern language contains four related pattern categories: Business Patterns, Integration Patterns, Application Patterns, and Runtime Patterns. These pattern categories organise an e-business architecture into three layers-business interaction, application infrastructure and middleware infrastructure-and provide reusable design solutions to these layers in a top-down decomposition fashion. Business and Integration Patterns partition the business interaction layer into a set of subsystems; Application Patterns provide a high-level application infrastructure for these subsystems and separate business abstractions from their software solutions; Runtime Patterns then define a middleware infrastructure for the subsystems and shield design solutions from their implementations. The paper describes, demonstrates and evaluates this pattern language.	e-business architecture; architectural design; pattern; pattern languages; software architecture; e-business architecture;  architectural design;  pattern;  pattern languages;  software architecture	Zhao, Liping; Macaulay, Linda; Adams, Jonathan; Verschueren, Paul	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2007.11.717	Aho, A.V., Ullman, J.D.Principles ofCited 102 times.Compiler, London, UK 1977; Gamma, E., Helm, R., Johnson, R., Vlissides, J.(1995)Design Patterns-Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.Cited 15562 times.Professional Computing; Lorenz, David H.; Appel, A.W., Palsberg, J.: Modem Compiler Implementation in Java.

122	OODP	An object-oriented application framework for DANS management	Object oriented technology provides the better solution for reusability, extensibility, and scalability by strong abstraction and encapsulation. We present the object oriented application framework classes that represent the abstract object model for supporting AM (accounting management), CM (configuration management), FM (fault management), PM (performance management), and SM (security management) functionality in DANS (Distributed Access Node System). We also present the design pattern that facilitates the reuse of software architecture for event handling in a multitasking environment. The proposed Actor-Reactor pattern provides the framework of software architecture to handle the synchronous and asynchronous operations efficiently.

123	OODP	An object-oriented client/server architecture for video-on-demand applications	One of the most important standardization efforts in the broad field of audiovisual coding is MPEG-4 that introduces objects as smallest accessible units inside frames. This creates new possibilities in scalable scene compositions where more interesting foreground objects (e. g. a news speaker) can be lossy encoded with a better quality than a less interesting background object. This leads to new degrees of freedom in achieving high compression rates. Furthermore, this new audiovisual coding paradigm provides new functionalities in interactive audiovisual presentations. In this paper,, we present a prototype realization of a video-on-demand application that enables distributed event handling of object-related events created by a user. Our system consists of a client/server architecture, where the client side handles events like zooming or moving single video objects at presentation time, while the server side considers user control concerning the quality of a lossy encoding of the single video objects. The term object-oriented stands for the access of objects rather them frames in our coding scheme as well as the object-oriented design of our software system by means of aggregation, association or inheritance. This paper describes the architecture of our system by explaining how the desired distributed functionality can be achieved. The software is entirely written in the Java language. Therefore, platform independence is achieved by using the Java Virtual Machine. Javab_x0019_s multithreading capabilities are used to design a highly extendible and flexible system that can be dynamically configured at runtime. The overall functionality of the system is explained with OMT class diagrams, block diagrams and state diagrams describing a protocol exchange by client and server, including the influence of the user interaction on the quality of the transmitted video objects.

However, we did not find, in the literature, works applying such patterns in the optimization of Product Line Architecture (PLA). Existing works offer manual approaches, which are not search-based, and only apply specific patterns in particular domains. Considering this fact, this paper introduces a meta-model and a mutation operator to allow the design patterns application in the search-based PLA design. The model represents suitable scopes, that is, set of architectural elements that are suitable to receive a pattern. The mutation operator is used with a multi-objective and evolutionary approach to obtain PLA alternatives. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of empirical results show an improvement in the quality of the obtained solutions.

125	OODP	Analysis of design patterns for composite telco services	The adoption of IT-based interfaces to monitor and control telco capabilities is a consolidated approach. In such a scenario the end-users design composite services that orchestrate functions implemented through one or more resources managed by telecom operators. In addition to the issues that have to be faced to support the design of composite services in general, in this case it is also necessary to face issues that are specific to the telco domain. In fact, telco services strongly rely on the processing of asynchronous events generated by resources; moreover, they usually handle large and dynamic sets of concurrent processes that execute long-running transactions each of which includes interactions between the composite service and the telco capabilities. The complexity of the telco domain suggests to define a set of patterns to ease the development of composite services. The goal of this paper is to propose such patterns and to show how they can be implemented both as plain Java objects and as BPEL processes. The pattern based approach is illustrated by means of a service which takes advantage of the combined use of multiple patterns. Moreover, the paper suggests some improvements on the definition of the interfaces and on the reference model for the development of composite services.

133	OODP	Applications of the generic programming paradigm in the design of CGAL	We report on the use of the generic programming paradigm in the computational geometry algorithms library CGAL. The parameterization of the geometric algorithms in CGAL enhances flexibility and adaptability and opens an easy way for abolishing precision and robustness problems by exact but nevertheless efficient computation. Furthermore, we discuss circulators, which are an extension of the iterator concept to circular structures. Such structures arise frequently in geometric computing.		Bronnimann, H.

136	OODP	Applying pattern oriented software engineering to web service development	Service-based software development is becoming a prominent paradigm. However, less attention has been paid to the development method of Web service. In this paper, a pattern oriented service development approach (POSE) is presented. Patterns are used as the means to express the results of different development phases, so that the services can be organized and retrieved easily. The business model is constructed explicitly, thus the gap between business goal and services is bridged by the component relationships and the compositions of them. The service maintainer profits from the trace ability because the impact of requirement or design modifications can be better assessed. The patterns support to integrate services of varying levels of granularity.

137	OODP	Applying systems engineering for adding value in the built environment	"Defining and managing the value, price and costs of buildings has proven to be difficult. The characteristics of construction, including fragmented demand and supply chains, complex projects, one shot development and long lead times are basic causes, often leading to cost and time overruns, value loss and dissatisfied clients. In this paper a systems engineering model for the construction industry is presented for the dynamic and integrated control of value, price and costs across the demand and supply chain, i.e. through the cascade of value demanding and value supplying parties. The basic paradigm of the model is to maximize the total benefit of the built object, which is the sum of the aggregate profit for supplying parties and the added value for demanding parties. The model is extended over the life cycle aimed at achieving ultimate life cycle benefit of building objects viewed as built functional objects through the life cycle. In order to achieve this the paper proposes continuing involvement of all parties in the demand and supply chain through the formation of a stakeholder alliance which is established through the entire life cycle aimed at the maintenance of the long-term functionality and serviceability of the built object. Systems engineering can be used by suppliers in order to offer client specific solutions as unique combinations of products belonging to product families. In that way the basic industrialised approach of the ""normal"" world can be copied by the construction world, leading to better and cheaper buildings. The result is that the demand driven supply (pull market) will be changed into a supply driven demand (push) which is beneficial to all stakeholders in the construction industry."

138	OODP	Applying translucid contracts for modular reasoning about aspect and object oriented events	The Implicit Invocation (II) architectural style improves modularity and is promoted by aspect-oriented (AO) languages and design patterns like Observer. However, it makes modular reasoning difficult, especially when reasoning about control effects of the advised code (subject). Our language Ptolemy, which was inspired by II languages, uses translucid contracts for modular reasoning about the control effects; however, this reasoning relies on Ptolemy's event model, which has explicit event announcement and declared event types. In this paper we investigate how to apply translucid contracts to reasoning about events in other AO languages and even non-AO languages like C#.

139	OODP	Architecting blockchain network simulators: A model-driven perspective	Blockchain networks have been suggested to have the potential to support some of the most critical functions of modern societies. When used in such capacities, failures of blockchain networks imply catastrophes that extend beyond individuals, organizations and countries. As such, before considered for wide adoption, blockchain network protocols and technologies must undergo the highest standards of analytical and empirical validation subject to key security, reliability and performance qualities. When performing empirical evaluation, however, the sheer size of open-access blockchain networks in their envisioned scale rules out the possibility of exact reproduction and validation in a lab environment. Rather, abstract working models - simulators - of proposed technologies need to be considered. To have value as research instruments, such simulators need to be widely validated for their accuracy by the research community, and also be highly transparent and reusable for allowing quick implementation and comparison of design ideas. We claim that established software engineering paradigms, namely model-driven development and software product lines can help address this need. We outline our own effort to develop a domain meta-model and object-oriented framework for efficient and reliable derivation of specialized blockchain network simulators.

140	OODP	Architectural Design Patterns for Flight Software	Software design patterns are best practice solutions to common software design problems. When they are properly applied, software design patterns can greatly improve the quality of software architectures. However, applying design patterns in practice can be difficult since design pattern descriptions are domain and platform independent. Leveraging the benefits of design patterns is particularly important in the space flight software (FSW) domain because better designs are needed to help reduce the number of in flight software related anomalies. In order to address the aforementioned problems, this paper presents software architectural design patterns for space flight software. This paper describes how architectural design pattern templates can be used to build common features of FSW architectures. The FSW architectures produced can be validated for functional and performance correctness.

141	OODP	Aria language towards agent orientation paradigm	Agent oriented paradigm is one of the new contributions to the field of software engineering and has the potential to significantly improve current practice of the field. The paradigm should be elaborated both practically and conceptually. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, an agent oriented language called Aria and its compiler are proposed. Aria language is a superset of Java language and the compiler compiles a program in Aria to an equivalent program in Java. This enables Aria to fully integrate with and preserve all the existing knowledge and code in Java. Secondly, the three well-known object oriented principles of abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism are redefined for agent orientation. Two sample cases are presented: a chat room and an agent oriented MVC pattern.

142	OODP	Aspect orientation and the new square standard for software requirements; [La orientacion a aspectos y el nuevo estandar square para requisitos de software]	Aspect oriented software development (AOSD), based on aspect oriented programming (AOP), is part of the post-object paradigm of software engineering. This study deals with the early treatment of crosscutting concerns combined with classical engineering requirements processes in which quality requirements are relevant. In spite of the increasing interest in this line of research, a homogenous vision of the terminology involved is yet to be established. The goal of this work is to integrate the main concepts used in AOSD, with the notions of engineering requirements and the recent ISO/IEC 25030 software quality requirements terminology, setting the basis for a better understanding and consensus towards a common vocabulary for the emerging Aspect Oriented Quality Requirements Engineering discipline. The main result of this integration is a UML conceptual model.

143	OODP	Aspect oriented programming paradigm	Reuse is one of the major promises of object-oriented programming. Unfortunately, this promise is only partially achieved. One of the sources of this failure is the mix of the applications basic functionalities code with non-functional properties code (e.g. distribution, fault tolerance, persistence). In order to avoid this weakness, the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm proposes to split applications implementation into aspects representing either functionalities or non-functional properties. Then, an application is built by composing (b_x001C_assemblingb_x001D_) various aspects. We have identified three different approaches allowing AOP. In this paper, we present and discuss these approaches and the concepts behind AOP.		Bouraqadi-Saadani, N.M.N. (1); Ledoux, T.

144	OODP	AspectC2C: A symmetric aspect extension to the C language	By separating crosscutting concerns into modules, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) can greatly improve the maintainability, understandability and reusability of software. However, the asymmetric paradigm adopted by most AOP extensions could bring crosscutting concerns into the aspect code and thus limit the reusability of aspects. Symmetric paradigms have been proposed to alleviate such limitations, but few extensions on such paradigm target at non-object-oriented languages, such as C. In this paper, we propose a symmetric aspect extension to the C language, called AspectC2C, and discuss implementation issues and benefits of this new extension comparing to the asymmetric ones.

146	OODP	Aspect-oriented development of cluster computing software	In complex software systems, modularity and readability tend to be degraded owing to inseparable interactions between concerns that are distinct features in a program. Such interactions result in tangled code that is hard to develop and maintain. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a powerful method for modularizing source code and for decoupling cross-cutting concerns. A decade of growing research on AOP has brought the paradigm into many exciting areas. However, pioneering work on AOP has not flourished enough to enrich the design of distributed systems using the refined AOP paradigm. This article investigates three case studies that cover time-honored issues such as fault-tolerant computing, network heterogeneity, and object replication in the cluster computing community using the AOP paradigm. The aspects that we define here are simple, intuitive, and reusable. Our intensive experiences show that (i) AOP can improve the modularity of cluster computing software by separating the source code into base and instrumented parts, and (ii) AOP helps developers to deploy additional features to legacy cluster computing software without harming code modularity and system performance.

147	OODP	Aspect-oriented Programming to Improve Modularity of Object-oriented Applications	The separation of concerns design principle improves software reutilization, understandability, extensibility and maintainability. By using the object-oriented paradigm, it is not always possible to separate into independent modules the different concerns of an application. The result is that the source code of crosscutting concerns are tangled and scattered across the whole application. Aspect-oriented programming offers a higher level of modularity, providing a solution for the code tangling and scattering problem. To show how aspect-oriented programming can be used as a suitable mechanism to improve the modularity of object-oriented applications, this divulgative article presents the implementation of a typical design pattern following both the object and aspect-oriented paradigms. The two approaches are compared from the modularity perspective, establishing a discussion on the benefits provided and is current use.		Felix, J.M. (1); Ortin, F.

148	OODP	Aspect-oriented requirements engineering for advanced separation of concerns: A review	Software engineering was introduced to cope with software crisis with two fundamental principles: separation of concerns and modularity. Many programming paradigms have been proposed and used while considering the fundamental principles from the early days. Complex software systems were successfully modularized but complete separation of concerns is still impossible to achieve using today's most popular programming paradigms such as object-oriented programming. There are some concerns which could not be separated properly in a single class or module due to their highly coupling with other classes or modules' behaviors. We call such unmodularized concerns as crosscutting concerns and these are responsible for scattering and tangling. Aspects are the natural evolution of the object-oriented paradigm. They provide a solution to some difficulties encountered with object-oriented programming, sometimes scattering and tangling. Hence, Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) is another step towards achieving improved modularity during software development. It gives emphasis to the separation of crosscutting concerns i.e. advanced separation of concerns and encapsulation of crosscutting concerns in separate modules, known as aspects. It later uses composition mechanism to weave them with other core modules at loading time, compilation time, or run-time. Aspect-Oriented Requirements Engineering (AORE) is an early phase in AOSD that supports separation of crosscutting concerns at requirements level. It does not replace but rather complements any of the existing requirements methodologies. Over the last few years, several research efforts have been devoted to this area. Several techniques for crosscutting concern identification have already been proposed. In this paper, an attempt is made to review the existing approaches and understand their contribution to requirements engineering.

149	OODP	Aspect-oriented workflow languages	Most available aspect-oriented languages today are extensions to programming languages. However, aspect-orientation, which is a paradigm for decomposition and modularization, is not only applicable in that context. In this paper, we introduce aspect-oriented software development concepts to workflow languages in order to improve the modularity of workflow process specifications with respect to crosscutting concerns and crosscutting changes. In fact, crosscutting concerns such as data validation and security cannot be captured in a modular way when using the constructs provided by current workflow languages. We will propose a concern-based decomposition of workflow process specifications and present the main concepts of aspect-oriented workflow languages using AO4BPEL, which is an aspect-oriented workflow language for Web Service composition.

150	OODP	Assessment of the image misregistration effects on object-based change detection	High-spatial resolution remote sensing imagery provides unique opportunities for detailed characterization and monitoring of landscape dynamics. To better handle such data sets, change detection using the object-based paradigm, i.e., object-based change detection (OBCD), have demonstrated improved performances over the classic pixel-based paradigm. However, image registration remains a critical pre-process, with new challenges arising, because objects in OBCD are of various sizes and shapes. In this study, we quantified the effects of misregistration on OBCD using high-spatial resolution SPOT 5 imagery (5. m) for three types of landscapes dominated by urban, suburban and rural features, representing diverse geographic objects. The experiments were conducted in four steps: (i) Images were purposely shifted to simulate the misregistration effect. (ii) Image differencing change detection was employed to generate difference images with all the image-objects projected to a feature space consisting of both spectral and texture variables. (iii) The changes were extracted using the Mahalanobis distance and a change ratio. (iv) The results were compared to the 'real' changes from the image pairs that contained no purposely introduced registration error. A pixel-based change detection method using similar steps was also developed for comparisons. Results indicate that misregistration had a relatively low impact on object size and shape for most areas. When the landscape is comprised of small mean object sizes (e.g., in urban and suburban areas), the mean size of 'change' objects was smaller than the mean of all objects and their size discrepancy became larger with the decrease in object size. Compared to the results using the pixel-based paradigm, OBCD was less sensitive to the misregistration effect, and the sensitivity further decreased with an increase in local mean object size. However, high-spatial resolution images typically have higher spectral variability within neighboring pixels than the relatively low resolution datasets. As a result, accurate image registration remains crucial to change detection even if an object-based approach is used.

(iv) The results were compared to the 'real' changes from the image pairs that contained no purposely introduced registration error. A pixel-based change detection method using similar steps was also developed for comparisons. Results indicate that misregistration had a relatively low impact on object size and shape for most areas. When the landscape is comprised of small mean object sizes (e.g., in urban and suburban areas), the mean size of 'change' objects was smaller than the mean of all objects and their size discrepancy became larger with the decrease in object size. Compared to the results using the pixel-based paradigm, OBCD was less sensitive to the misregistration effect, and the sensitivity further decreased with an increase in local mean object size. However, high-spatial resolution images typically have higher spectral variability within neighboring pixels than the relatively low resolution datasets. As a result, accurate image registration remains crucial to change detection even if an object-based approach is used. (c) 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

151	OODP	Assisting the development of aspect-based multi-agent systems using the Smartweaver approach	Current software engineering trends are increasingly reasoning about large-scale applications in terms of multi-agent systems (MAS). Along this line, frameworks have been regarded as useful instruments to express a variety of agent models. However, despite the advantages of this approach, the MAS paradigm also introduces additional complexity into the development process. The central problem is that developers usually have to understand, select and organize a broad set of agency features in order to build final applications. Moreover, these features tend to be not orthogonal with respect to object structures. Thus, aspects appear as a promising alternative to achieve a better separation of concerns in MAS. In this context, the article presents an approach called Smartweaver, which basically gives assistance for the development of MAS applications, using a combination of multi-agent and aspect frameworks. A novel aspect of this work is the use of planning techniques to generate sequences of programming tasks to guide the implementation of applications on top of these frameworks. By doing so, the approach allows developers to better take advantage of MAS patterns, components and frameworks.

152	OODP	Astro2020 APC white paper scheduling discovery in the 2020s	The 2020s will be the most data-rich decade of astronomy in history. On the ground and in space, powerful facilities like LSST, JWST, massive multi-object spectroscopic surveys, and a wide variety of smaller robotic and queue-based telescopes will be repeatedly scanning the sky. However, without additional effort we are unlikely to realize the full scientific potential of our investments in these instruments. As the scale and complexity of our surveys and instruments increase, the problem of scheduling (which observations, in what order?) becomes more critical. First, prudence dictates maximizing the efficiency of facilities with high development costs and finite lifetimes. Second, key scientific projects-including identifying unseen populations of compact objects, understanding stellar binarity, and discovering and classifying rare classes of transients-require complex history-dependent observational sequences. To date most scheduling of astronomical facilities has relied on very basic approaches: typically manual scheduling by human operators or simple 'greedy' algorithms with basic objective functions. We argue that these approaches are insufficient for the scientific needs of the 2020s. Thankfully, knowledge from fields such as Operations Research is beginning to percolate into astronomy. Surveys such as LCO, ALMA, ZTF, Swift and LSST are applying new algorithms to improve their efficiency and quantitative scientific throughput. However, much work remains to be done. To maximize science in the 2020s, we must develop high-quality scheduling approaches, implement them as open-source software, and begin linking the typically separate stages of observation and data analysis. The latter provides real-time feedback maximizing progress towards the scientific goal-the so-called 'fifth paradigm'1 of science (Szalay, 2019). We provide an overview of key research directions as well as recommendations for scientists, facilities, and agencies to facilitate progress in the field. Copyright B) 2019, The Authors.

We first motivate the development of our framework by analysing available guidance and the current practice in the field. Subsequently, we recapitulate on the design of the framework-paco, pattern design in the context space-and present its key concepts and methods. The evaluation of paco aimed to investigate how useful this framework is in a real-world environment. It was conducted in two phases: experts in auditory display design first captured successful designs through paco and created a body of design patterns. These patterns were subsequently used in a controlled experiment with novice designers who were given a design task that forced them to use audio. The results demonstrate that paco has facilitated the transfer of design knowledge and good practice from experts to novices through design patterns. The context space, a key concept in paco, improves the contextual awareness of designers and provides an organising principle for problems, patterns and artefacts. We close by reflecting on the results and discussing future lines of research.

154	OODP	Automatic detection of coupling type in the UML sequence diagram	The quality of source code is an important stake for the construction of software. The source code quality facilitates the maintenance and the evolution of the program. In the object-oriented paradigm, a modular system is easy to maintain thanks to its components with strong cohesion and weak or low coupling. Weak coupling is among the key factor to reduce the cost and the deadline of the system developing and maintaining. We propose to evaluate this factor since the design of system. In this paper, the proposed approach consists in the automatic detection of coupling type in the object-oriented design level. To do this, we have elaborated rules to detect the strongest coupling type. It belongs then to the designer to do redesign for a weak coupling code. As a result, the proposed strategy detects the types of coupling within each UML sequence diagram object at the design level. To validate our strategy, we conducted a case study. Then, the results obtained are adapted in a fuzzy architecture for validation. And finally, the output of the fuzzy architecture is a fuzzy membership function of total output coupling. The results show that our approach helps designers and software developers to obtain a better quality of software product.

155	OODP	Automatic recommendation of design patterns based on patternsb_x0019_ intent	The gang-of-four (GoF) patterns provide best practices and reusable solutions to recurrent problems in object-oriented software design. We propose an automatic approach for ranking and recommending GoF patterns. Design-pattern vectors, representing the GoF patterns in terms of the problem types they address, are constructed based on the design pattern intent ontology (DPIO) developed by Kampffmeyer. An input design problem is represented as an input-problem vector, constructed by matching terms extracted from its description with constraints and concepts characterizing problem types in the DPIO. Patterns are ranked and recommended based on similarity scores computed between the design-pattern vectors and the input-problem vector. The proposed method was evaluated on a collection of 36 design problems. With appropriate parameter setting, the actual answers to 69.44% and 83.33% of the problems were recommended within the top-3 and top-5 ranks, respectively. With additional term correspondences for improvement of term matching, the results were increased to 75.00% and 88.89% for the top-3 and top-5 ranks, respectively. Compared to text-based pattern ranking using a vector space model, our proposed method yielded significantly better performance when they were evaluated on the same problem collection.

Using design patterns in software development improves the product's quality, understandability and productivity. However, it is a challenging task for novice developers to select the right design pattern to solve a design problem. The paper proposes a methodology for the automatic selection of the fit design pattern from a list of patterns. The proposed methodology is based on Text retrieval approach where the design problem scenarios are described in natural language. A vector space model (VSM) was created for the catalogue of design patterns. A vector of features consists of unigrams and bigrams is generated for the given design problem scenario. The recommended design pattern is the closest to the problem scenario. The proposed mechanism was evaluated using the Gang of four design patterns and the experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.		Hamdy, A. (1); Elsayed, M.

157	OODP	Automatic software generation in the OORHS distributed computing framework	Software generation in the OORHS (object-oriented reciprocative hypercomputing system) is user-transparent. It addresses the issue of ease of use by minimizing the number of steps leading to a programming solution. The OORHS requires from the user only a highlevel APPL program, which is, in effect, a specification. For every APPL program, the system automatically performs all the necessary distributed computing steps. The precompiler, based on the object-oriented paradigm, instantiates the encapsulated program objects embedded in an APPL program. These program objects are distributed at the source level. They are compiled and then executed at the allocated sites. This unique approach, known as local compilation, eliminates the need to store the compilers used by other machines locally. It enhances the compatibility between the compiled program and the host processor. The precompiler generates a program objects dictionary for every APPL program. The contents in the dictionary facilitates program visualization.

158	OODP	BabyJ: From object based to class based programming via types	Object oriented programming can be classified into the object based, and the class based paradigm. Object based languages typically are weakly typed and interpreted, allow member addition and removal, and thus they support flexibility and prototyping. Class based languages are usually strongly typed and compiled, require a rigid class structure and class membership, and thus they support more robust, type safe programs. The two paradigms therefore address the needs of different stages in the programming lifecycle: object based programming better fits the earlier, exploratory phases, whereas class based better fits the latter, consolidation and maintenance phases. Because the transition from one paradigm to the other is not straightforward, programs tend to be developed in one of the two paradigms, thus foregoing the advantages of the other. We suggest that this need not be so, and that the benefits of the two paradigms can be combined: The earlier, exploratory, programming phases should take place in an object based setting. Then, the program should be incrementally annotated with types. Once fully typed, the program can be mapped onto an equivalent class based program. We demonstrate these ideas through the introduction of BabtJ, a formalization of Javascript. We define BabyJ T, a typed extension of BabyJ. A permissive type in BabyJ allows the typing process to be incremental. We then define a meaning preserving transformation of BabyJT programs to Java programs.

159	OODP	Bad-smell metrics for aspect-oriented software	Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a new programming paradigm that improves separation of concerns by decomposing the crosscutting concerns in aspect modules. Bad smells are metaphors to describe software patterns that are generally associated with bad design and bad programming of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). New notions and different ways of thinking for developing Aspect-Oriented (AO) software inevitably introduce bad smells which are specific bad design and bad programming in AO software called AO bad smells. Software metrics have been used to measure software artifact for a better understanding of its attributes and to assess its quality. Bad-smell metrics should be used as indicators for determining whether a particular fraction of AO code contains bad smells or not. Therefore, this paper proposes definition of metrics corresponding to the characteristic of each AO bad smell as a means to detecting them. The proposed bad-smell metrics are validated and the results show that the proposed badsmell metrics can preliminarily indicate bad smells hidden in AO software.

161	OODP	Beating the city: Three inspirational design patterns to promote social play through aligning rhythms	"This paper offers three inspirational design patterns for sparking social play between unacquainted people in public and semi-public spaces. The intention is to support developers in appreciating and articulating possible approaches in creating physical or digital artefacts as interventions that encourage unacquainted people to play together in urban areas.

162	OODP	Beyond object-oriented software development	Some difficulties in software development can't be overcome using the OO paradigm. Although OOP works well at modularizing core concerns, it falls short when it comes to modularize crosscutting concerns. The growing complexity of today's software makes it necessary for developers to deal with more and more crosscuting concerns. The goal of this chapter was to present how post-OO paradigms improves SoC. The principles of AOP and CF's were explained and illustrated by 3 scenerio of adapting software to new requirements. Both AspectJ and CF's solutions have the following advantages over its ancestor: the crosscutting concern is explicitly implemented: instead of being embedded in the code of core concerns; the evolution of the OO systems is simplified: new language constructs are offered; core concerns can be easily reused: crosscutting concern are not interwinded with core concerns. Although the presented post-OO paradigms introduce new problems to software development, they indicate the direction in which the programming techniques should evolve.		Przybylek, A.

163	OODP	Bilateral Haptic Collaboration for Human-Robot Cooperative Tasks	The aim of this letter is to introduce the concept of bilateral haptic cooperation as a novel paradigm for human-robot cooperative tasks. The approach is demonstrated with a system composed of a soft gripper and a wearable interface. The soft gripper, called CoGripper, has been designed to guarantee a safe interaction giving the possibility to the operator to reconfigure the device according to the object to be grasped. The wearable interface is used to control the open/close motion of the gripper and to feedback information about important task parameters, e.g., the grasp tightness. The result is a bilateral haptic collaboration where human and robot bidirectionally communicate through the interface. The user interaction with the system is extremely intuitive and simple. We performed three user studies to prove the effectiveness of bilateral haptic collaboration involving ten subjects. Results confirmed that the use of the wearable interface reduces the time to accomplish a cooperative task and enables a better control of the grasp tightness.

164	OODP	Blended analysis for performance understanding of framework-based applications	This paper defines a new analysis paradigm, blended program analysis, that enables practical, effective analysis of large framework-based Java applications for performance understanding. Blended analysis combines a dynamic representation of the program calling structure, with a static analysis applied to a region of that calling structure with observed performance problems. A blended escape analysis is presented which enables approximation of object effective lifetimes, to facilitate explanation of the usage of newly created objects in a program region. Performance bottlenecks stemming from overuse of temporary structures are common in framework-based applications. Metrics are introduced to expose how, in aggregate, these applications make use of new objects. Results of empirical experiments with the Trade benchmark are presented. A case study demonstrates how results from a blended escape analysis can help locate, in a region which calls 223 distinct methods, the single call path responsible for a performance problem involving objects created at 9 distinct sites and as far as 6 call levels away.

165	OODP	Bridging patterns: An approach to bridge gaps between SE and HCI	Adding usability improving solutions during late stage development is to some extent restricted by the software architecture. However, few software engineers and human-computer interaction engineers are aware of this important constraint and as a result avoidable rework is frequently necessary. In this paper we present a new type of pattern called a bridging pattern. Bridging patterns extend interaction design patterns by adding information on how to generally implement this pattern. Bridging patterns can be used for architectural analysis: when the generic implementation is known, software architects can assess what it means in their context and can decide whether they need to modify the software architecture to support these patterns. This may prevent part of the high costs incurred by adaptive maintenance activities once the system has been implemented and leads to architectures with better support for usability.

166	OODP	Bringing foresight into systems thinking - A three horizons approach	A primary goal of systemic intervention is the improvement of the 'system in question'. The definition of the system in question is often itself a function of multiple stakeholders and is not a fixed object. Boundary critique can be helpful in clarifying the ambiguity, assumptions and the power dynamics around agreeing what the system is that is to be improved and for whose interests. However, there is another dimension of ambiguity which is time. Improvement implies some change from a present condition A to a better future condition B which eventually becomes a new present condition B. Where the environment is about to go through a significant change of pattern (a paradigm shift), the criteria of improvement will be different, depending which paradigm is being considered. For example, energy success in an unrestricted environment can be completely different from energy success in a restricted environment dominated by climate change. In this paper we will introduce the idea of three ways of looking at the future using a method called the three horizons. It will point out three distinct ways of looking at the future, each of which will strongly colour boundary critique and therefore affect what is considered to be a successful or 'improved' system. The foresight framing suggests improvement to sustain the current system, improvement which is a disruptive innovation and may reconfigure the system and improvement which is transformative and may actually result in the collapse of the systems in question.

167	OODP	Business Process Design Method Based on Business Event Model for Enterprise Information System Integration	The traditional business process design methods, in which the usecase is the most typical, have no useful framework to design the activity sequence with. Therefore, the design efficiency and quality vary widely according to the designer's experience and skill. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose the business events and their state transition model (a basic business event model) based on the language/action perspective, which is the result in the cognitive science domain. In the business process design, using this model, we decide event occurrence conditions so that every event synchronizes with each other. We also propose the design pattern to decide the event occurrence condition (a business event improvement strategy). Lastly, we apply the business process design method based on the business event model and the business event improvement strategy to the credit card issue process and estimate its effect.

170	OODP	C++ advisor: Improving a design with patterns	Probably the most important step forward in object-oriented design is the design patterns movement, chronicled in Design Patterns by Erich Gamma and others. (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1995). This book shows 23 different solutions to particular classes of problems, organized around the question what will change as this program evolves? This is generally the most important question you can ask about any design. If you can build your system around the answer, the benefits will be two-pronged: not only will your system allow easy (and inexpensive) maintenance, but you also can produce reusable components so other systems can be built more economically. This is the promise of object-oriented programming, but it does not happen automatically-it requires thought and insight. We look at how this process can happen during the refinement of a system, using the trash-recycling problem. The goal of the design is to make the addition of types as painless as possible. In the recycling program, we want to encapsulate all places where specific type information is mentioned so any changes can be localized to those encapsulations. As a result, this process also cleans up the rest of the code considerably.

171	OODP	CAA-DRIP: A framework for implementing coordinated atomic actions	"This paper presents an implementation framework, called CAA-DRIP, that has been defined to allow a straight-forward implementation of dependable distributed applications designed using the Coordinated Atomic Action (CAA) paradigm. CAAs provide a coherent set of concepts adapted to the design of fault tolerant distributed systems that includes: structured transactions, distribution, cooperation, competition, and forward and backward error recovery mechanisms triggered by exceptions. DRIP (Dependable Remote Interacting Processes) is an efficient Java implementation framework, which provides support for implementing ""Dependable Multiparty Interactions (DMI)"" which includes a general exception handling mechanism. As DMI has a softer exception handling semantics with respect to CAA semantics, a CAA design can be implemented by DRIP. The aim of the CAA-DRIP framework is to provide a set of Java classes that allows programmers to implement only the semantics of CAAs with the same terminology and concepts at the design and implementation levels. The new framework simplifies the implementation phase and at the same time reduces the size of the final system since it requires fewer number of instances for creating a CAA at runtime. Details of these improvements as well as a precise description of the CAAs behaviour in terms of Statecharts, which is used as a reference model to define the CAA-DRIP framework, are presented in this paper."

172	OODP	Cachet: A decentralized architecture for privacy preserving social networking with caching	Online social networks (OSNs) such as Facebook and Google+ have transformed the way our society communicates. However, this success has come at the cost of user privacy; in today's OSNs, users are not in control of their own data, and depend on OSN operators to enforce access control policies. A multitude of privacy breaches has spurred research into privacy-preserving alternatives for social networking, exploring a number of techniques for storing, disseminating, and controlling access to data in a decentralized fashion. In this paper, we argue that a combination of techniques is necessary to efficiently support the complex functionality requirements of OSNs. We propose Cachet, an architecture that provides strong security and privacy guarantees while preserving the main functionality of online social networks. In particular, Cachet protects the confidentiality, integrity and availability of user content, as well as the privacy of user relationships. Cachet uses a distributed pool of nodes to store user data and ensure availability. Storage nodes in Cachet are untrusted; we leverage cryptographic techniques such as attribute-based encryption to protect the confidentiality of data. For efficient dissemination and retrieval of data, Cachet uses a hybrid structured-unstructured overlay paradigm in which a conventional distributed hash table is augmented with social links between users. Social contacts in our system act as caches to store recent updates in the social network, and help reduce the cryptographic as well as the communication overhead in the network. We built a prototype implementation of Cachet in the FreePastry simulator. To demonstrate the functionality of existing OSNs we implemented the 'newsfeed' application. Our evaluation demonstrates that (a) decentralized architectures for privacy preserving social networking are feasible, and (b) use of social contacts for object caching results in significant performance improvements.

174	OODP	Cell GC: Using the cell synergistic processor as a garbage collection coprocessor	In recent years, scaling of single-core superscalar processor performance has slowed due to complexity and power considerations. To improve program performance, designs are increasingly adopting chip multiprocessing with homogeneous or heterogeneous CMPs. By trading off features from a modern aggressive superscalar core, CMPs often offer better scaling characteristics in terms of aggregate performance, complexity and power, but often require additional software investment to rewrite, retune or recompile programs to take advantage of the new designs. The Cell Broadband Engine is a modern example of a heterogeneous CMP with coprocessors (accelerators) which can be found in supercomputers (Roadrunner), blade servers (IBM QS20/21), and video game consoles (SCEI PS3). A Cell BE processor has a host Power RISC processor (PPE) and eight Synergistic Processor Elements (SPE), each consisting of a Synergistic Processor Unit (SPU) and Memory Flow Controller (MFC). In this work, we explore the idea of offloading Automatic Dynamic Garbage Collection (GC) from the host processor onto accelerator processors using the coprocessor paradigm. Offloading part or all of GC to a coprocessor offers potential performance benefits, because while the coprocessor is running GC, the host processor can continue running other independent, more general computations. . We implement BDW garbage collection on a Cell system and offload the mark phase to the SPE co-processor. We show mark phase execution on the SPE accelerator to be competitive with execution on a full fledged PPE processor. We also explore object-based and block-based caching strategies for explicitly managed memory hierarchies, and explore to effectiveness of several prefetching schemes in the context of garbage collection. Finally, we implement Capitulative Loads using the DMA by extending software caches and quantify its performance impact on the coprocessor.

175	OODP	CEOS - a cost estimation method for evolutionary, object-oriented software development	The authors present a method for estimating the effort of software projects following an evolutionary, object oriented development paradigm. Effort calculation is based on decomposing systems into manageable building blocks (components, subsystems, classes), and assessing the complexity for all their associated development cycles. Most terms of the complexity calculation formulae carry coefficients which represent their individual weights, ranging from factors for particular features up to general influence factors of the project environment. These coefficients can continuously be improved by statistical regression analysis. Outstanding features of the method are its flexibility (allowing estimations for project portions of any size) and its capability to deal with dynamic adjustments which might become necessary due to changed plans during project progress. This capability reflects the evolutionary character of software development and, in particular, implies revision, use and evaluation activities.		Sarferaz, S. (1); Hesse, W.

176	OODP	Chameleon: A new operating system concept for supporting multimedia	New algorithms are being incorporated into operating systems to deal the requirements of multimedia applications. However, typical system design techniques such as structured programming, global variables and implied dependencies are impeding this development and proof of correctness. Techniques from the object-orientation paradigm are now being incorporated to better manage these issues. This paper introduces Chameleon, a new object-oriented operating system design concept that takes an original approach to design and implementation to achieve a high degree of adaptability and retain the performance of a m-kernel.

177	OODP	Chemical foundations of distributed aspects	Distributed applications are challenging to program because they have to deal with a plethora of concerns, including synchronization, locality, replication, security and fault tolerance. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a paradigm that promotes better modularity by providing means to encapsulate crosscutting concerns in entities called aspects. Over the last years, a number of distributed aspect-oriented programming languages and systems have been proposed, illustrating the benefits of AOP in a distributed setting. Chemical calculi are particularly well-suited to formally specify the behavior of concurrent and distributed systems. The join calculus is a functional name-passing calculus, with both distributed and object-oriented extensions. It is used as the basis of concurrency and distribution features in several mainstream languages like C# (Polyphonic C#, now Co), OCaml (JoCaml), and Scala Joins. Unsurprisingly, practical programming in the join calculus also suffers from modularity issues when dealing with crosscutting concerns. We propose the aspect join calculus, an aspect-oriented and distributed variant of the join calculus that addresses crosscutting and provides a formal foundation for distributed AOP. We develop a minimal aspect join calculus that allows aspects to advise chemical reactions. We show how to deal with causal relations in pointcuts and how to support advanced customizable aspect weaving semantics. We also provide the foundation for a decentralized distributed aspect weaving architecture. The semantics of the aspect join calculus is given by a chemical operational semantics. We give a translation of the aspect join calculus into the core join calculus, and prove this translation correct by a bisimilarity argument. This translation is used to implement Aspect JoCaml on top of JoCaml.

178	OODP	Choosing a framework in open source development	The use of frameworks enables reductions in development time and complexity. Among the application frameworks available for open source development are Struts and Turbine. Both make use of the model view controller (mvc) design pattern which separates application software, presentation software and back-end data. Two variants exist - mvc1 and the more advanced mvc2 application frameworks implement a design pattern and consist of a code base with reusable components, and a number of utility classes. Pattern formats include the Java-based JSP and Velocity. The Struts and Turbine frameworks are compared regarding structure, operation, use with pattern formats and J2EE standards, and support. Struts is favoured due to its full use of mvc2 and better documentation.		Smeman, S.	Informatie			2015-10-01 00:00:00							2					Kluwer Bedrijfswetenschappen, Netherlands	
179	OODP	CICM: A robust method to measure cognitive complexity of procedural and object-oriented programs	Cognition defines the ease of understanding or the property of comprehension. Comprehension is the key feature that distinguishes any entity as being complex or simple. Comprehensibility of a problem helps in efficient design solution and improvement of software product quality. Thus property of comprehensibility can be used to understand the complexity of a particular programming paradigm. Object-oriented paradigm is built on the notion of real world entities. This paradigm has received higher acceptability among the programming community. This is because the programs written using an object-oriented language are easier to comprehend as compared to the procedural programs. Hence this paper makes an attempt to apply Cognitive Information Complexity Measure (CICM) on object-oriented program and proves that cognitive complexity for any procedural program is greater than the cognitive complexity of the same program written in object-oriented software.

180	OODP	Class movement and re-location: An empirical study of Java inheritance evolution	Inheritance is a fundamental feature of the Object-Oriented (OO) paradigm. It is used to promote extensibility and reuse in OO systems. Understanding how systems evolve, and specifically, trends in the movement and re-location of classes in OO hierarchies can help us understand and predict future maintenance effort. In this paper, we explore how and where new classes were added as well as where existing classes were deleted or moved across inheritance hierarchies from multiple versions of four Java systems. We observed first, that in one of the studied systems the same set of classes was continuously moved across the inheritance hierarchy. Second, in the same system, the most frequent changes were restricted to just one sub-part of the overall system. Third, that a maximum of three levels may be a threshold when using inheritance in a system; beyond this level very little activity was observed, supporting earlier theories that, beyond three levels, complexity becomes overwhelming. We also found evidence of 'collapsing' hierarchies to bring classes up to shallower levels. Finally, we found that larger classes and highly coupled classes were more frequently moved than smaller and less coupled classes. Statistical evidence supported the view that larger classes and highly coupled classes were less cohesive than smaller classes and lowly coupled classes and were thus more suitable candidates for being moved (within an hierarchy).

181	OODP	Classifying relationships between object-oriented design patterns	Since the publication of the Design Patterns book (E. Gamma et al., 1994), a large number of object-oriented design patterns have been identified and codified. As part of the pattern form, object-oriented design patterns must indicate their relationships with other patterns, but these relationships are typically described very briefly, and different collections of patterns describe different relationships in different ways. In this paper, we describe and classify the common relationships between object-oriented design patterns. Practitioners can use these relationships to help them identity those patterns which may be applicable to a particular problem, and pattern writers can use these relationships to help them integrate new patterns into the body of the patterns literature.

In this paper, we describe and classify the common relationships between object-oriented design patterns. Practitioners can use these relationships to help them identity those patterns which may be applicable to a particular problem, and pattern writers can use these relationships to help them integrate new patterns into the body of the patterns literature.

185	OODP	Cognitive weave pattern prioritization in fabric design: An application-Oriented approach	Weave patterns are amongst the most popular design patterns in society's daily lives with numerous applications. In the fabric design process, designer selects weave patterns based on the cognitive interpretation of the material structure in the fabric texture. In the selection activity of weave patterns, texture indexing and prioritization are curial tasks. These are associated with a cognitive process of interpretation and understanding of the texture elements in the woven structure of fabrics. In this regard, the authors use an interdisciplinary approach to help designer select weave texture patterns through structure and texture features and implement new algorithms that take into account essential features or rules in fabric pattern design. The features and algorithms are designed based on the object-attribute-relation (OAR) model and a cognitive informatics model. Three essential cognitive features of weave patterns are proposed, (1) the complexity of patterns in the fabric production process, (2) the structural appearance feature, and (3) cognitive tracking features for weave patterns. The authors' experiments on a wide variety of weave patterns show that the proposed approach is capable of effectively prioritizing the cognitive features of weave patterns in fabric texture design process.

186	OODP	Co-inflow: Coarse-grained information flow control for java-like languages	Coarse-grained dynamic information-flow control (IFC) is a good match for imperative object-oriented programming languages such as Java. Java language abstractions align well with coarse-grained IFC concepts, and so Java can be cleanly extended with coarse-grained dynamic IFC without requiring significantly different design patterns or excessive security annotations, and without excessive performance overhead.We present Co-Inflow: an extension of Java with coarse-grained dynamic IFC. By careful design choices and defaults, a programmer typically needs to add very few annotations to a Java program to convert it to a Co-Inflow program with relatively good precision. Additional annotations can improve precision.

    abstract = ""Coarse-grained dynamic information-flow control (IFC) is a good match for imperative object-oriented programming languages such as Java. Java language abstractions align well with coarse-grained IFC concepts, and so Java can be cleanly extended with coarse-grained dynamic IFC without requiring significantly different design patterns or excessive security annotations, and without excessive performance overhead.We present Co-Inflow: an extension of Java with coarse-grained dynamic IFC. By careful design choices and defaults, a programmer typically needs to add very few annotations to a Java program to convert it to a Co-Inflow program with relatively good precision. Additional annotations can improve precision. We achieve this tradeoff between precision and annotation burden by instantiating and specializing recent advances in coarse-grained IFC for a Java-like setting, and by using opaque labeled values: a restriction of labeled values that the Co-Inflow runtime automatically and securely creates and uses.We have captured the essence of Co-Inflow in a middle-weight imperative calculus, and proven that it provides a termination- insensitive non-interference security guarantee.

188	OODP	Comparative evaluation of programming paradigms: Separation of concerns with object-, aspect-, and context-oriented programming	There are many programming paradigms for the separation of concerns (SoC). Each paradigm modularizes concerns in a different way. Context-oriented programming (COP) has been developed as a supplement to objectoriented programming (OOP), which is one of the most widely used paradigms for SoC. It modularizes concerns that are difficult for OOP. In this paper, we focus on three paradigms - OOP, aspect-oriented programming (proposed as a supplement to OOP that has a different approach from COP), and COP - And study whether COP can modularize concerns better than other two paradigms in given situations. Then we determine the reasons why COP can or cannot better modularize concerns.

This paper describes an alternative approach to software construction. Java Layers (JL). and evaluates JL and frameworks in terms of flexibility, ease of use, and support for evolution. Our experiment compares Schmidt's ACE framework against a set of ACE design patterns that have been implemented in JL. We show how problems of framework evolution and overfeaturing can be avoided using JL's component model. and we demonstrate that JL scales better than frameworks as the number of possible application features increases. Finally, we describe how constrained parametric polymorphism and a small number of language features can support n l s model of loosely coupled components and stepwise program refinement.

190	OODP	Comparison and benchmarks for import of VPF geographic data from object-oriented and relational database files	Presents some of the advantages accrued from adopting an object-oriented (OO) data model versus the relational data model when representing and managing a vector product format (VPF) database, specifically the digital nautical chart (DNC) for Norfolk Harbor, Virginia. An OO-DNC prototype viewer capable of importing, displaying and editing DNC feature data from both relational-format and object-format files was developed using the Smalltalk language. The differences in performance between the relational import and the object import were then compared across several DNC coverages. The results indicate a significant increase in performance when adopting the OO paradigm; specifically, the OO-DNC viewer imported feature data from object-format files from 6 to 15 times faster than from the relational-format files. It should be noted that these figures are NOT the result of comparing a commercial OO database management system (OODBMS) against a commercial relational database management system (RDBMS), but rather the result of reading both relational-oriented and OO data file formats using an OO program written in Smalltalk. Nevertheless, we feel these results indicate a significant functionality and performance improvement can be obtained by using an OO framework for the data and software.		Arctur, D. (1); Anwar, E.

191	OODP	Compensation of Adapted Service Orchestration Logic in BPEL'n'Aspects	BPEL'n'Aspects is a non-intrusive mechanism for adaptation of control flow of BPEL processes based on the AOP paradigm. It relies on Web service standards to weave process activities in terms of aspects into BPEL processes. This paper is a logical continuation of the BPEL'n'Aspects approach. Its main objective is to enable compensation of weaved-in Web service invocations (activities) in a straightforward manner. We present (1) requirements on a mechanism for compensation of weaved-in process activities; (2) the corresponding concepts and mechanisms to meet these requirements; (3) an example scenario to show the applicability of the approach; and (4) a prototypical implementation to prove the feasibility of the solution. This work represents an improvement in the applicability of this particular adaptation approach since processes in production need the means to compensate actions that are included into processes as result of an adaptation step, too. The concept is generic and hence can also be used by other approaches that adapt control flow.

The Complex Operator pattern is intended to separate the shape and content of an object structure from its concrete representation. Because Builder and Visitor are so closely related they are relatively easy to compose and enhancements to one may be applicable to the other.		Wilkins, A.J. (1); Jenness, J.

194	OODP	Component-based software development - A new paradigm in software engineering?	Component-based software development is associated with a shift from statement-oriented coding to system building by plugging together components. The idea is not new and some progress has been made over the past decades. Nevertheless, today's software development practice is still far away from the vision. In recent years, the term componentware has become the vogue in the software engineering community. This paper defines the relevant terms by relating them to the already well-established terms of object technology. In particular, the focus lies on a discussion of the deficiencies of the object-oriented paradigm and how componentware might solve these shortcomings. Furthermore, the role of object-oriented frameworks as underlying technology of plug & play software is illustrated. Finally, the paper tries to answer the question of whether some enhancements of the object-oriented paradigm indeed represent the dawn of a new era of software development.

195	OODP	Composing design patterns: A scalability study of aspect-oriented programming	Pattern composition has been shown as a challenge to applying design patterns in real software systems. One of the main problems is that multiple design patterns in a system are not limited to affect only the application concerns. They also crosscut each other in multiple heterogeneous ways so that their separation and composition are far from being trivial. In this context, it is of paramount importance to systematically verify whether aspect-oriented programming (AOP) supports improved composability of design patterns. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how AOP scales up to deal with modularization of pattern-specific concerns in the presence of pattern interactions. We have made both qualitative and quantitative assessments of 62 pair-wise compositions taken from 3 medium-sized systems implemented in Java and AspectJ programming languages. Our analysis has also included the evaluation of compositions involving more than two patterns. The assessment was based on four fundamental software attributes, namely separation of concerns, coupling, cohesion, and conciseness.

198	OODP	Computing Dynamic Slices of Feature--Oriented Programs Using Execution Trace File	Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP) is a general paradigm for synthesizing programs in software product lines. A family of software systems constitutes a software product line (SPL). The unique characteristics of feature-oriented programs such as mixin layers, refinements of classes, refinements of constructors, constants, refinements, etc. pose special difficulties in the slicing of these programs. This paper proposes a dynamic slicing algorithm for feature-oriented programs. The algorithm is named Execution Trace File Based Feature-Oriented Dynamic Slicing (ETBFODS) algorithm. The ETBFODS algorithm uses a dependence based representation called Dynamic Feature Composition Dependence Graph (DFCDG) and an execution trace file to store execution history of the program for a given input. The dynamic slice is computed by traversing the DFCDG in breadth--first or depth-first wise and then mapping the resultant traversed vertices to the program statements.

Based on analysis of large part process features and adopting principles of object-oriented as well as feature technology, tasks were classified according to process type and complicatedness, sequence feature library was set up accordingly. In practice, according to specific process feature and process type of special parts, process feature model oriented to task management was constructed by applying part feature library. And then task classification and allocation were conducted. For complicated process scheme, task could be decomposed to a series of independent subtask according to process feature. Concurrent process design process was realized by subtask management and monitoring. By using this novel process design pattern, unified management for complicated process design tasks was realized, design flexibility and efficiency were also improved.

200	OODP	Construction of component repository for supporting the CBD process	CBD (component based development) has become the best strategical method for business applications. Because CBD is a new development paradigm making it possible to assemble software components for application, it copes with the challenge of business processes and meets the increasing requirements for productivity. Since the business process is rapidly changing, CBD technology is a promising way of solving productivity. The repository is the most important part for the development, distribution and reuse of components. In a component repository, we can store and manage related work products produced at each step of component development as well as the component itself. In this paper, we suggest a practical approach for repository construction to support and realize the CBD process and develop the CRMS (component repository management system) as an implementation product of the proposed techniques. CRMS can manage a variety of component products based on component architecture, and help software developers to search a candidate component for their project and to understand a variety of information for the component. In the paper, a practical approach for a component repository was suggested, and a supporting environment was constructed to make CBD work efficiently. We expect this work will be valuable research for a component repository and the entire supporting component based development process.

201	OODP	Construction of the dependence matrix based on the TRIZ contradiction matrix in OOD	In the Object-Oriented software design (OOD), design of the class and object, definition of the classesb_x0019_ interface and inheritance levels and determination of dependent relations have a serious impact on the reusability and flexibility of the system. According to the concrete problems of design, how to select the right solution from the hundreds of the design schemas which has become the focus of attention of designers. After analyzing lots of software design schemas in practice and Object-Oriented design patterns, this paper constructs the dependence matrix of Object-Oriented software design filed, referring to contradiction matrix of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) proposed by the former Soviet Union innovation master Altshuller. As the practice indicates, it provides a intuitive, common and standardized method for designers to choose the right design schema.

202	OODP	Context-oriented software engineering: A modularity vision	There are a number of constructs to implement context-dependent behavior, such as conditional branches using if statements, method dispatching in object-oriented programming (such as the state design pattern), dynamic deployment of aspects in aspect-oriented programming, and layers in context-oriented programming (COP). Uses of those constructs significantly affect the modularity of the obtained implementation. While there are a number of cases where COP improves modularity, it is not clear when we should use COP in general. This paper presents a preliminary study on our software development methodology, the context-oriented software engineering (COSE), which is a use-case-driven software development methodology that guides us to a specification of context-dependent requirements and design. We provide a way to map the requirements and design formed by COSE to the implementation in our COP language ServalCJ. We applied COSE to two applications in order to assess its feasibility. We also identify key linguistic constructs that make COSE effective by examining existing COP languages. These feasibility studies and examination raise a number of interesting open issues. We finally show our future research roadmap to address those issues.

203	OODP	Continuation/frame-based semantics for aspect matching and weaving	Aspect-orientation has gained a lot of attention from researchers. This concept emerged as an appropriate paradigm to improve the modularization of crosscutting concerns, such as security, logging, and synchronization. In this paper, we provide formal semantics for aspect matching and weaving for a core language based on l-calculus. We adopt the pointcut-advice model, one of the fundamental and most popular AOP mechanisms. We consider basic pointcuts, i.e., get, set, call, and exec pointcuts. The semantics is based on a defunctionalized continuation-passing style since the latter provides a concise, accurate, and elegant description of AOP mechanisms.

204	OODP	Controlling the destruction order of singleton objects	Singletons have to be destroyed just like any other objects. When and how that happens can be a tricky problem to solve. I examine the existing singleton implementations and analyze their advantages and drawbacks. I also propose an improved singleton implementation, which detaches the singleton object from its function wrapper, and then combine that implementation with other design patterns to achieve a certain behavior. Using the compound singleton-registration-proxy pattern, I implement a destruction manager, which controls the lifetime of a singleton and ensures that the given singleton exists as long as it is needed.

205	OODP	Cooperative aspect-oriented programming	Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) seeks to improve software modularity via the separation of cross-cutting concerns. AOP proponents often advocate a development strategy where programmers write the main application (base code), ignoring crosscutting concerns, and then aspect programmers, domain experts in their specific concerns, weave in the logic for these more specialized cross-cutting concerns. This purely oblivious strategy, however, has empirically been shown to tightly couple aspects to base code in many cases, hindering aspect modularity and reuse. In essence, the more intricate the weaving between the cross-cutting concern and the base code (lexically and/or semantically), the harder it becomes to: (a) robustly specify how to weave the aspects in at the required points, (b) capture interactions between aspects and base code, and	Aspect-oriented programming; Extensibility; Join point; Modularity; Aspect-oriented programming;  Extensibility;  Join point;  Modularity	Hoffman, Kevin; Eugster, Patrick	SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2009.01.003		333-354	"""@article{WOS:000265390900006,

AOP proponents often advocate a development strategy where programmers write the main application (base code), ignoring crosscutting concerns, and then aspect programmers, domain experts in their specific concerns, weave in the logic for these more specialized cross-cutting concerns. This purely oblivious strategy, however, has empirically been shown to tightly couple aspects to base code in many cases, hindering aspect modularity and reuse. In essence, the more intricate the weaving between the cross-cutting concern and the base code (lexically and/or semantically), the harder it becomes to: (a) robustly specify how to weave the aspects in at the required points, (b) capture interactions between aspects and base code, and (c) preserve the correct weaving as the base code evolves. We propose an alternate methodology, termed cooperative aspect-oriented programming (Co-AOP), where complete lexical separation of concerns is not taken as an absolute requirement. Instead, cross-cutting concerns are explicitly modeled as abstract interfaces through explicit join points (EJPs). Programmers specify where these interfaces interact with base code either through explicit lexical references or via traditional oblivious aspects. This explicit awareness allows base code and aspects to cooperate in ways that were previously not possible: arbitrary blocks of code can be advised, advice can be explicitly parameterized, base code can guide aspects in where to apply advice, and aspects can statically enforce new constraints upon the base code that they advise. These new techniques allow aspect modularity and program safety to increase, and bring us towards a cooperative ACIP paradigm. We illustrate our methodology via an example on transactions, and also give an initial evaluation of cooperative AOP through an empirical study on program extensibility comparing both the traditional and cooperative AOP methodologies. Initial results show that cooperative AOP techniques result in code that is less complex with lower overall coupling, facilitating extensibility. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."",

206	OODP	CORBA and intelligent networks (IN)	The article discusses design of a CORBA/IN Interworking function (IWF). A static IN/CORBA IWF is proposed, residing on the INAP/TCAP layer, between Service Switch Function (SSF) and the Service Control Function (SCF). It is argued that the IWF should facilitate a smooth, real time interaction between the SS7 domain and the CORBA domain. In particular, the IWF should address harmonisation of the asynchronous, message oriented communication paradigm of the SS7 domain and the blocking, connection oriented paradigm of the CORBA domain. The IWF should also deal with the vital, low-level, real time, concurrent, event-based, queue-oriented aspects of the interaction and provide the IN service developer with high-level CORBA interfaces. The CORBA Event Service or the coming Message Service, enhanced with real-time and reliability requirements necessary for IN, is suggested for the interaction between the CORBA domain and the IN/CORBA IWF.

208	OODP	Coupling and cohesion as modularization drivers: Are we being over-persuaded?	"For around three decades Software Engineering gurus have ""sold"" us the ideal of minimal coupling and maximal cohesion at all levels of abstraction as a way to reduce the effort to understand and maintain software systems. The object-oriented paradigm brought a new design philosphy and encapsulation mechanisms that apparently would help us to achieve that desideratum. However, after a decade where this paradigm has emerged as the dominant one, we are faced with practitioners' reality: coupling and cohesion do not seem to be the dominant driving forces when it comes to modularization. This conclusion was based on a relatively large sample of heterogeneous systems. We describe an environment that allows not only assessing this reality but also deriving better modularization solutions in what concerns coupling and cohesion. These solutions are generated by means of cluster analysis techniques and partially preserve the original modularization criteria. We believe this approach can be of great help in reengineering actions of object-oriented legacy systems."

212	OODP	CSAP - an adaptable security module for the e-government system Webocrat	In this paper we present a generic and adaptable security module called CSAP (Communication, Security, Authentication, and Privacy) which may be used in order to make e-government and e-commerce systems secure and trustworthy. CSAP is service-oriented and offers programming interfaces to core security services such as user identification, authentication, access control, auditing, and security management. We discuss the conceptual architecture, the layered design, and the object-oriented implementation of CSAP. The layered design of CSAP allows the application developer to exchange or enhance security mechanisms via a plug-in concept based on abstract classes and appropriate design patterns. As a consequence, CSAP becomes maintainable and adaptable. Among other services, CSAP provides an implementation of a role based access control sub system that conforms to the Core RBAC model as defined in the proposed NIST standard. Currently, CSAP is almost fully implemented and integrated in the WEBOCRAT system which - in the framework of e-government - provides services supporting direct participation of citizens in democratic processes in a secure way.

213	OODP	An accurate on-demand time synchronization protocol for wireless sensor networks	Time synchronization is a critical component in any wireless sensor network (WSN). In terms of energy consumption, on-demand time synchronization is better than continuous synchronization. However, currently existing on-demand time synchronization protocols have a very low accuracy and very strong spatial accumulative effect. These features are not suitable for several types of WSN applications, such as applications with stringent temporal requirements, or applications that have a large spatial region of interest. In this paper, we propose an on-demand time synchronization protocol, named AOTSP (Accurate On-demand Time Synchronization Protocol), which differs from other protocols of the same category by having the following advantages, as shown in our theoretical analysis and simulation results: (1) weak spatial accumulative effect; (2) fairly low communication cost; (3) low computational complexity; (4) high accuracy; (5) high scalability. Such features make AOTSP a suitable time synchronization protocol for a broad range of WSN applications.

215	OODP	Database pointers in navigational and object-oriented database management systems: a comparison	As information systems and, more specifically, database management systems, attempt to model particular application environments, they must be able to account for and keep track of how the entities in the environments relate to each other. In the first or navigational generation of DBMS, relationships were maintained by pointer chains that connected the records representing the related entities. In the second or relational generation of DBMS, the tuples, representing related entities were not connected by pointers, but could be b_x001C_joinedb_x001D_ at query time based on common values of particular fields. In the third or object oriented generation of DBMS, there are two major structural approaches. One is a pointer based approach while the other, is designed to add advanced, object oriented features to the relational model. Recently, perhaps inevitably, interest in the object oriented pointer based approach has led to questions of whether it is, in some sense, a return to navigational DBMS. While object oriented database clearly has major features that go far beyond the capabilities of first generation DBMSs, this article will show that a comparative analysis of pointer usage in navigational DBMS and in object oriented DBMS can yield interesting results, plus a better understanding of the object oriented DBMS paradigm.

216	OODP	Datatype-generic programming meets elaborator reflection	Datatype-generic programming is natural and useful in dependently typed languages such as Agda. However, datatype-generic libraries in Agda are not reused as much as they should be, because traditionally they work only on datatypes decoded from a library's own version of datatype descriptions; this means that different generic libraries cannot be used together, and they do not work on native datatypes, which are preferred by the practical Agda programmer for better language support and access to other libraries. Based on elaborator reflection, we present a framework in Agda featuring a set of general metaprograms for instantiating datatype-generic programs as, and for, a useful range of native datatypes and functions-including universe-polymorphic ones-in programmer-friendly and customisable forms. We expect that datatype-generic libraries built with our framework will be more attractive to the practical Agda programmer. As the elaborator reflection features used by our framework become more widespread, our design can be ported to other languages too.

217	OODP	Declarative design pattern-based development using aspect oriented programming	Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) can help to reduce crosscut-ting in the implementation of Design Patterns (DP), due to typical deficiencies of Object Oriented languages that can affect negatively the quality of the overall software system. The implementation of DPs may be further improved by using Model Driven Development techniques together with AOP. We have defined an approach to specify and to apply, declaratively, DPs to the classes of the base system. A Domain Specification Language (DSL) has been defined to specify declaratively the structure of DPs and their adoption on classes. From the DSL specifications, aspects are derived to compose, at run-time, an AOP-based version of the specified DPs. The approach was validated by a case study where the developed supporting framework was used in a concrete development scenario, and subsequent maintenance task. The results from the case study are presented and discussed.

218	OODP	Deeper Siamese Network with Stronger Feature Representation for Visual Tracking	Siamese network based visual tracking has drawn considerable attention recently due to the balanced accuracy and speed. This type of method mostly trains a relatively shallow twin network offline, and measures the similarity online using cross-correlation operation between the feature maps generated by the last convolutional layer of the target and search regions to locate the object. Nevertheless, a single feature map extracted from the last layer of shallow networks is insufficient to describe target appearance, as well as sensitive to the distractors, which could mislead the similarity response map and make the tracker easily drift. To enhance the tracking accuracy and robustness while maintaining the real-time speed, based on the above tracking paradigm, three improvements including reform of backbone network, fusion of hierarchical features and utilization of channel attention mechanism, have been made in this paper. Firstly, we introduce a modified deeper VGG16 backbone network, which could extract more powerful features contributing to distinguishing the target from distractors. Secondly, we fuse diverse features extracted from deep layers and shallow layers to take advantage of both semantic and spatial information of the target. Thirdly, we incorporate a novel lightweight residual channel attention mechanism into the backbone network, which expands the weight gap between different channels and helps the network pay more attention on dominant features. Extensive experimental results on OTB100 and VOT2018 benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker performs better in accuracy and efficiency against several state-of-the-art methods in real-time scenarios.

219	OODP	Defect proneness estimation and feedback approach for software design quality improvement	Context: Modern software engineering demands professionals and researchers to proactively and collectively work towards exploring and experimenting viable and valuable mechanisms in order to extract all kinds of degenerative bugs, security holes, and possible deviations at the initial stage. Having understood the real need here, we have introduced a novel methodology for the estimation of defect proneness of class structures in object oriented (OO) software systems at design stage. Objective: The objective of this work is to develop an estimation model that provides significant assessment of defect proneness of object oriented software packages at design phase of SDLC. This frame work enhances the efficiency of SDLC through design quality improvement. Method: This involves a data driven methodology which is based on the empirical study of the relationship existing between design parameters and defect proneness. In the first phase, a mapping of the relationship between the design metrics and normal occurrence pattern of defects are carried out. This is represented as a set of non linear multifunctional regression equations which reflects the influence of individual design metrics on defect proneness. The defect proneness estimation model is then generated by weighted linear combination of these multifunctional regression equations. The weighted coefficients are evaluated through GQM (Goal Question Metric) paradigm. Results: The model evaluation and validation is carried out with a selected set of cases which is found to be promising. The current study is successfully dealt with three projects and it opens up the opportunity to extend this to a wide range of projects across industries. Conclusion: The defect proneness estimation at design stage facilitates an effective feedback to the design architect and enabling him to identify and reduce the number of defects in the modules appropriately. This results in a considerable improvement in software design leading to cost effective products.

220	OODP	Degenerate parametric oscillation in quantum membrane optomechanics	The promise of innovative applications has triggered the development of many modern technologies capable of exploiting quantum effects. But in addition to future applications, such quantum technologies have already provided us with the possibility of accessing quantum-mechanical scenarios that seemed unreachable just a few decades ago. With this spirit, in this work we show that modern optomechanical setups are mature enough to implement one of the most elusive models in the field of open system dynamics: degenerate parametric oscillation. Introduced in the eighties and motivated by its alleged implementability in nonlinear optical resonators, it rapidly became a paradigm for the study of dissipative phase transitions whose corresponding spontaneously broken symmetry is discrete. However, it was found that the intrinsic multimode nature of optical cavities makes it impossible to experimentally study the model all the way through its phase transition. In contrast, here we show that this long-awaited model can be implemented in the motion of a mechanical object dispersively coupled to the light contained in a cavity, when the latter is properly driven with multichromatic laser light. We focus on membranes as the mechanical element, showing that the main signatures of the degenerate parametric oscillation model can be studied in state-of-the-art setups, thus opening the possibility of analyzing spontaneous symmetry breaking and enhanced metrology in one of the cleanest dissipative phase transitions. In addition, the ideas put forward in this work would allow for the dissipative preparation of squeezed mechanical states.

222	OODP	Deriving patterns from design principles	A good design pattern has many desirable properties. Most of these properties are also embodied in abstract design principles. However, there is a large gap between abstract principles and the concrete architectures of patterns; therefore, design remains hard in spite of the wealth of knowledge on principles and applications. Systematic transformation techniques, which enforce observance of design principles and rules, can be used to derive well-known patterns starting from trivial designs.

223	OODP	Describing and composing patterns using role diagrams	Design patterns are patterns of classes and objects that represent solutions to recurring design problems. They are usually described using class diagrams. Class diagrams, however, often intertwine the actual solution with efficient ways of implementing it. The paper uses role diagrams to describe and compose patterns. Role diagrams help designers focus on the collaborations and distribution of responsibilities between objects. Role diagrams also are a better starting point for composing patterns. The paper presents several examples and reports on first experiences with using role diagrams for composing patterns, which have been promising.		Riehle, D. (1)	WOON. White Object-Oriented Nights.

224	OODP	Design and Analysis of Aspect Oriented Metric CWCoAR Using Cognitive Approach	Aspect Oriented Software Development is a new and emerging paradigm, which supports the separation of concerns that are scattered over the system. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) extends the traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) model to improve code reuse across different object hierarchies. AOP can be used with object oriented programming. AspectJ is an implementation of aspect-oriented programming for Java. AspectJ adds to Java just one new concept, a join point and that adds name for an existing Java concept. Maintainability is regarded a software attribute that plays a vital role in software quality level. If the software's quality level is higher, the less effort/cost the software maintenance cycle requires. Software metrics are used in quantifying desirable software and software development characteristics of aspect oriented software development (AOSD). The maintenance cost can be controlled if software metrics is utilized during the development phase. This paper proposes and defines a new Cognitive Weighted Coupling on Attribute Reference (CWCoAR) complexity metric.

225	OODP	Design and Development of Train Air-conditioning Controller Interface Based on Linux and Qt	Good air-conditioning system is an important reflection of passenger comfort. Traditional air-conditioning controller interface is mostly realized by the combination of PLC(Programmable Logic Controller) and configuration software. However, with the continuous development of urban trains, the requirements of control accuracy, response speed and equipment expansion are constantly improved. Therefore, this paper presents the design and development of train air-conditioning controller interface based on Linux platform and Qt framework. Firstly, the design method and requirements of the interface are determined from the user-centered point of view, and then on this basis the framework of the interface is determined. Secondly, the interface drawing, control association, data refreshing and thread safety which are realized by Qt framework and C++ design pattern are introduced. Thirdly, the PID(Proportion Integral Derivative) control model of air-conditioning controller is established with temperature as input and air-conditioning unit as control object.

234	OODP	Design of communication protocols using a message transfer pattern	Design patterns help to improve software quality and reduce development cost by reusing experience of experts for recurring problems. Patterns have potential to be useful in almost all areas of software systems, but to date they are mainly concentrated on the development of object-oriented systems. In this paper, we apply the pattern concept to the description of communication protocols, particularly focusing on message interaction. We hypothesize that many communication protocols can be developed using a few recurring patterns to obtain an initial design description of a system. For the protocol description, we propose a set of patterns which are grouped in two categories: structural and behavioural patterns. A complex protocol can be obtained by composing such patterns. To show the usefulness of our patterns in a realistic application, we perform a case study for an ATM signalling protocol design.

235	OODP	DESIGN OF OBJECT-ORIENTED FUNCTIONS IN S FOR SCREEN DISPLAY, INTERFACE AND CONTROL OF OTHER PROGRAMS (SAS AND LATEX), AND S-PROGRAMMING	We describe a set of object oriented S functions that harness the automatic printing facility in S to convert an S object to another format. We devise new classes and subclasses of objects in S: file (with subclasses source, sas, dvi, latex, ps, and xli), display, and expr (closely related to objects of mode expression); print methods (families of related functions that depend on the class of the argument) for the new classes; and other families of functions that depend on environmental variables. We give examples for displaying an S object in its own window on the user's workstation, for converting a data frame to a LATEX table, for displaying S help files in a TEX window on a workstation, and for converting a data frame to a system file for another software system. We show how to put a SAS program inside an iterative loop controlled by S. We give applications to programming and debugging in S. We discuss design issues in constructing the functions and relating the individual members of the set of functions to each other and to the object oriented paradigm in the underlying S program.

236	OODP	Design pattern as a service for blockchain applications	Blockchain is an innovative distributed ledger technology which has attracted a wide range of interests for building the next generation of applications to address lack-of-trust issues in business. Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. The existing BaaS solutions mostly focus on easier and faster deployment of blockchain applications. However, design of blockchain applications is challenging to developers as it requires development experiences and deep understanding of blockchain technologies. Therefore, this paper summarises a set of design patterns and delivers them as a service to support design of blockchain application. We present a service platform which applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design of blockchain applications to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The platform also provides two auxiliary services, including key management and file comparison, which are often needed in blockchain applications.

    abstract = ""Blockchain is an innovative distributed ledger technology which has attracted a wide range of interests for building the next generation of applications to address lack-of-trust issues in business. Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. The existing BaaS solutions mostly focus on easier and faster deployment of blockchain applications. However, design of blockchain applications is challenging to developers as it requires development experiences and deep understanding of blockchain technologies. Therefore, this paper summarises a set of design patterns and delivers them as a service to support design of blockchain application. We present a service platform which applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design of blockchain applications to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The platform also provides two auxiliary services, including key management and file comparison, which are often needed in blockchain applications. The feasibility of the proposed solutions is evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case. (c) 2018 IEEE."",

237	OODP	Design pattern componentization: the decorator library in C#	Is it possible to convert design patterns into reusable components? This paper describes the study of the Decorator structural pattern and how this succeeded in producing a reusable library in C# 4.0 that satisfies the same requirements and intent of the original pattern. This paper describes the usage of the Decorator library, with a practical example and then proceeds to demonstrate the implementation of the library. The advantages and disadvantages of using the Decorator library rather than a traditional Decorator implementation are also discussed.		van Leeuwen, A.

238	OODP	Design pattern decay: The case for class grime	Context: We investigate class grime, a form of design pattern decay, wherein classes of the pattern realization have extraneous attributes or methods, which obfuscate the intended design of a pattern. Goal: To expand the taxonomy of class grime using properties of class cohesion. Using this expanded taxonomy we explore the effect that forms of class grime have on pattern realization understandability. Method: A pilot study utilizing a formal experiment to explore the effects of class grime on design pattern understandability. The experiments used simulated injection of 8 types of class grime into design pattern realizations randomly selected from 16 design pattern types from a set of 6541 realizations from 520 distinct software systems. Results: We found that for each of the 8 identified class grime forms, understandability was negatively affected. Conclusion: This work serves as early communication of research for the validation of the extended taxonomy as well as the method of grime injection used in the experiment.

239	OODP	Design pattern for self-organization multi-agent systems based on policy	Self-organization is an important characteristic for multi-agent systems. However developing self-organization multi-agent systems in a repeated and effective way is still a great challenge. It is well known that design patterns are the practice and knowledge about solutions for recurring problems, and reusing design pattern can significantly improve the software development quality and efficiency. On the other hand, current self-organization applications are still lack of effective way to handle the unpredicted environment and changing user requirements. In this paper, we take policy as the basic principle for self-organization multi-agent systems to solve this problem, and propose a policy based design pattern for the self-organization multi-agent systems.

241	OODP	Design Pattern Improvement of Chain of Responsibility	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) standard is used to implement traditional Chain of Responsibility (CoR) design pattern, which puts too much emphasis on the expansion process, without taking into account the complicated nature of space and time problem. The process causes waste of time and space greatly and reduces the treatment of complicated procedures. Aiming at the problems, a CoR creating process is presented, which uses delay initialization technology to reduce unnecessary requests for the creation of the treatment process. This method is not only a responsibility to maintain the chai's core applications and standards for the realization of the ideological model, but also can request in accordance with the actual code, to deal with the creation of specific examples, which greatly improves the performance of the procedure.

242	OODP	Design patterns as aspects: A quantitative assessment	Design patterns offer flexible solutions to common problems in software development. Recent studies have shown that several design patterns involve crosscutting concerns. Unfortunately, object-oriented (OO) abstractions are often not able to modularize those crosscutting concerns, which in turn decrease the system reusability and maintainability. Hence, it is important verifying whether aspect-oriented approaches support improved modularization of crosscutting concerns relative to design patterns. Ideally, quantitative studies should be performed to compare object-oriented and aspect-oriented implementations of classical patterns with respect to important software engineering attributes, such as coupling and cohesion. This paper presents a quantitative study that compares aspect-based and OO solutions for a representative set of design patterns. We have used stringent software engineering attributes as the assessment criteria. We have found that most aspect-oriented solutions improve separation of pattern-related concerns, although some aspect-oriented implementations of specific patterns resulted in higher coupling and more lines of code.

We first review well-known problems in the development of context-aware applications. Next, we present our view on the design process of context-aware software; we introduce design patterns and explain why they can be useful to improve the quality of this kind of applications. We finally present some design patterns we mined by researching on successful context-aware approaches. Some concluding remarks are finally presented together with further work we are pursuing.

246	OODP	Design patterns for real-time distributed system	Pattern is a software engineering problem-solving discipline. A pattern is a three-part rule that expresses a relation among a certain context, a problem, and a solution. It not only helps real-time distributed applications to meet performance requirement, but also improve reusability, scalability, maintainability, and portability. This paper surveys major patterns for concurrency, synchronization, resource management, and distribution.		Yiqin Xu (1); Sang, D.S.

247	OODP	Design patterns for serious games in tactical problem solving	Serious games are a promising medium for advancing training effectiveness, particularly in tactical problem solving; however, there are few empirically-based guidelines about how to best incorporate game elements into a particular training environment. Application of design pattern methodology, in which proven game element components in one training domain are identified and successfully 'migrated' to other domains, could greatly increase the effectiveness of game based training and significantly reduce the time and resources needed to develop a new game. This paper describes how the design pattern concept described in Dick & Spiker and Spiker & Dick was applied in the development of a serious game created to improve the training of a critical aviation skill, and how these design patterns can be migrated to a variety of other tactical problem solving areas.

248	OODP	Design Patterns for Smart Contracts in the Ethereum Ecosystem	The idea to digitally facilitate contract law and business practices through computer programs has led to the notion of smart contracts. Today's most prominent smart contract ecosystem is Ethereum, a blockchain based distributed computing platform. Due to the inherent nature of blockchain based contract execution, missing low level programming abstractions, and the constant evolution of platform features and security considerations, writing correct and secure smart contracts for Ethereum is a difficult task. Based on a Multivocal Literature Research and an analysis of the gathered data based on qualitative research methods, we mined a number of design patterns providing design guidelines. We describe those patterns in detail and provide exemplary code for better illustration. Our research shows that the patterns are widely used to address application requirements and common problems. We expect generalizability of some or all of the patterns for other smart contract ecosystems, but this is outside of the scope of this study, which studied only smart contract patterns in Ethereum.

    abstract = ""Drawing on Merritt's divide-and-conquer sorting taxonomy [1], we model comparison-based sorting as an abstract class with a template method to perform the sort by relegating the splitting and joining of arrays to its concrete subclasses. Comparison on objects is carried out via an abstract ordering strategy. This reduces code complexity and simplifies the analyses of the various concrete sorting algorithms. Performance measurements and visualizations can be added without modifying any code by utilizing the decorator design pattern. This object-oriented design not only provides the student a concrete way of unifying seemingly disparate sorting algorithms but also help him/her differentiate them at the proper level of abstraction."",

250	OODP	Design patterns in architectures based on use cases	Object-orientation claims to promote reuse and therefore reduce development rime and improve software quality. The reuse originally was considered at class level, that is, libraries of reusable classes. Progress in object technology gives today more importance to software architectures and design patterns. Any large object-oriented system should be built with design patterns. In this work we present an approach for developing an architecture based on use cases and the identification of some central design patterns. A case study exemplifying the proposed architecture is discussed.

253	OODP	Design reuse in hypermedia applications development	In this paper we discuss the use of design patterns for the process of building hypermedia applications. The idea of design patterns has been recently developed, and rapidly spread outside the object-oriented community to a general audience of software developers. By using patterns it is not only possible to document design experience with a very simple and comprehensible format, but also reuse the same experience several times for different applications. We argue that the hypermedia community will take a vital step towards better designs of hypermedia applications and systems by developing a pattern language for that domain.

254	OODP	Designing expression templates with concepts	Concepts are likely to be introduced in a future C++ standard. They can be used for constraining template parameters, which enables checking requirements on template parameters sooner in the compilation process, and thus providing more intelligible error messages to the user. They can also be used in the specialization of templates, thus leading to a better control over the selection of the most appropriate version of a template for a given instantiation. This latter aspect offers new possibilities in the design of template libraries, as it enhances the specialization mechanism of templates, and set it up as a solid alternative to inheritance when static binding can replace dynamic binding. This article addresses the design of expression templates (i.e., templates that represent expressions and are usually built through operator overloading) that are useful to develop an embedded domain specific language (EDSL), and can speed up the evaluation of an expression by delaying the evaluation of intermediate operations to avoid unnecessary temporary objects. We propose to use concept-based template specialization to parse expression templates in order to ease the design of an EDSL. This approach is a static variant of the well-known visitor design pattern that replaces the overridden methods in the double dispatch of the original design pattern by template specializations based on concepts. An example of EDSL for linear programming developed with our solution demonstrates that a concept-based design helps producing concise and reliable code.

256	OODP	Detecting Coupling and Cohesion Code Smells of JavaScript Classes; [Jian Ce JavaScriptLei De Nei Ju Ou He Code Smell]	Code Smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices. Detect and identify Code Smell precisely provide guidance on software refactoring, and lead to improvement of software usability and reliability. Design problems of software systems could be quantified through Code Smell metrics. JavaScript has become one of the most widely used programming languages, class is a design pattern of JavaScript, loose coupling and strong cohesion are characteristics of a well-designed class. Prior works measured coupling and cohesion Code Smells of JS programs in lower levels, i.e., function-wide and statement-wide, which were capable for providing refactoring suggestions about basic implementations, but not enough to identify design problems. This paper proposed JS4C, a method to detect coupling and cohesion Code Smells of JS classes including FE, DC and Blob. This method is an approach of static analysis works on both server and client-side applications, it iterates over every class in software system and takes advantage of source code textual patterns. While JS4C detects Code Smells, it also determines intensity for each of them.

    abstract = ""Code Smells are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices. Detect and identify Code Smell precisely provide guidance on software refactoring, and lead to improvement of software usability and reliability. Design problems of software systems could be quantified through Code Smell metrics. JavaScript has become one of the most widely used programming languages, class is a design pattern of JavaScript, loose coupling and strong cohesion are characteristics of a well-designed class. Prior works measured coupling and cohesion Code Smells of JS programs in lower levels, i.e., function-wide and statement-wide, which were capable for providing refactoring suggestions about basic implementations, but not enough to identify design problems. This paper proposed JS4C, a method to detect coupling and cohesion Code Smells of JS classes including FE, DC and Blob. This method is an approach of static analysis works on both server and client-side applications, it iterates over every class in software system and takes advantage of source code textual patterns. While JS4C detects Code Smells, it also determines intensity for each of them. Missing type information in static analysis is reinforced by extended object type inference and non-strict coupling dispersion (NSCDISP) metric during structural analysis. Experiments made on 6 open-sourced projects indicate that JS4C can correctly detect coupling and cohesion design problems. (c) Copyright 2021, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

One way to develop such solutions, a.k.a., Service-Based systems (SBSs) is to generate BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) processes via orchestrating Web services. Development of large business processes (BPs) involves design decisions. Improper and wrong design decisions in software engineering are commonly known as antipatterns, i.e., poor solutions that might affect the quality of design. The detection of antipatterns is thus important to ensure and improve the quality of BPs. However, although BP antipatterns have been defined in the literature, no effort was given to detect such antipatterns within BPEL processes. With the aim of improving the design and quality of BPEL processes, we propose the first rule-based approach to specify and detect BP antipatterns. We specify 7 BP antipatterns from the literature and perform the detection for 4 of them in an initial experiment with 3 BPEL processes.

258	OODP	Determining the degree of degradation of a historical and architectural object: Assessment Scale	The author's definition of the degradation of a historical and architectural object is derived in the article,taking into account the change in the paradigm of working with heritage and strengthening the humanitarian component in it. The degradation of a historical and architectural object is interpreted as the loss of its function and meaning for the people and the territory on which this object is located,caused by an underestimation of its value and socio-economic and cultural potential. Understanding the subjective components of degradation leads to the conclusion about the possibility of specialists' working with public opinion,and involving residents in project activities. Examples of the work of architects with degrading architectural objects are shown. The criteria for evaluating such objects that help to make reasoned professional decisions on working with objects of historical and architectural heritage are derived.

Currently used software design patterns are reinforced by families of their implementation methods, holders and components. They are described by an enhanced pattern language on hyper-document, organized by their relations, and measured by metrics of the family they belong to.

261	OODP	Development of new telecommunications services in distributed platforms: A structured approach	It is broadly accepted that the telecommunications industry is undergoing a fundamental restructuring. This is driven by new customer demands and by changes in the regulatory environment, and is both enabled and encouraged by rapid technological developments. Additionally, the demand for new sophisticated telecommunications services with multimedia characteristics is increasing. These services require more flexible access, management, and charging mechanisms. Thus, it is necessary to assist, in a systematic manner, telecommunications service designers in the development of new services. In this paper, after a brief examination of important service engineering matters, a service creation methodology is proposed and presented focusing on its essential characteristics. A possible enhancement of this methodology through the use of design patterns and frameworks is then considered.

262	OODP	DevOps service observability by-design: Experimenting with Model-View-Controller	The speeding growth of the IT market and its disruptive technologies, think of DevOps or Microservices, are leading towards using typical design patterns in a completely novel fashion. We consider the Model-View-Controller (MVC) as a target for a controlled refactoring experiment aimed at making it more observable, that is, mutated to be more easily monitorable in line with DevOps expectations. The article illustrates and implements our proposed mutation of MVC with observability. Using a proof-of-concept application prototype, the article illustrates how the improved observability can impact on general application maintainability -- we use common software metrics from the state of the art. We conclude that there are indeed forms for common design patterns (e.g., MVC) which are more monitorable but they are more expensive in terms of maintenance and hence require attention by the research community at large and further experimentation.

263	OODP	Diner -Waiter pattern in distributed control	As a useful and proven methodology in object-oriented design, design patterns are playing more and more important roles in distributed control system design. To improve the real-time performance and resource usage in distributed control, this paper proposes a novel design pattern: Diner-Waiter pattern.

265	OODP	Distinguishing uncertain objects with multiple features for crowdsensing	The development of the smartphones with various sensors, and powerful capabilities (computing, storage, and communication), motivates a popular computing and sensing paradigm, crowdsensing. In general, in crowdsensing, the smart-phones sense and collect the sensory data from a large number of smartphone users, for distinguishing the uncertain objects. However, some existing solutions for crowdsensing usually prefer to utilize only one or few features to distinguish the uncertain objects. In this paper, due to the limitation of less features, we propose to utilize multiple features to distinguish the uncertain objects for crowdsensing. For distinguishing uncertain objects with multiple features, we propose to utilize KL divergence based clustering. Moreover, we introduce two other mutated forms, the symmetry KL divergence and Jensen-Shannon KL divergence, to improve our algorithm. We evaluate our proposed schemes with real data of multiple features, which are collected by the smartphones with the sensors.

268	OODP	Diversity and agent technology	The diversity of interest in agent technology can in one sense be seen as a major weakness. But this diversity, and the fact that nobody `owns' agents is, the author believes, also a strength. It could be argued, for example, that the key weakness of expert systems technology was that, in the perception of the computing community at large, it was tied to a single technique-rule-based systems. Agent technology cannot be accused of having all its technological eggs in one basket-the field is far too diverse. The fact that the concept of an agent is common currency to so many widely different fields surely suggests that the concept of an agent is in some sense right. To draw an analogy, just as the world is populated by objects that have state and behaviour but which are essentially passive, so it is also populated by active entities. Object-oriented programming has proved to be such a successful paradigm at least in part because it allows us to model the world in terms of entities-objects-that more closely reflect the way in which we ourselves understand it (Booch, 1994). Agents are another such abstraction: they allow us to understand and model the world in terms of entities-individuals, organisations, groups, and so on-that we see in the everyday world. The author believes that agents will have value in helping us to understand how to design and implement a range of computer systems, in many disciplines.

269	OODP	Do rules and patterns affect design maintainability?	At the present time, best rules and patterns have reached a zenith in popularity and diffusion, thanks to the software community's efforts to discover, classify and spread knowledge concerning all types of rules and patterns. Rules and patterns are useful elements, but many features remain to be studied if we wish to apply them in a rational manner. The improvement in quality that rules and patterns can inject into design is a key issue to be analyzed, so a complete body of empirical knowledge dealing with this is therefore necessary. This paper tackles the question of whether design rules and patterns can help to improve the extent to which designs are easy to understand and modify. An empirical study, composed of one experiment and a replica, was conducted with the aim of validating our conjecture. The results suggest that the use of rules and patterns affect the understandability and modifiability of the design, as the diagrams with rules and patterns are more difficult to understand than non-rule/pattern versions and more effort is required to carry out modifications to designs with rules and patterns.

272	OODP	Documenting design-pattern instances: A family of experiments on source-code comprehensibility	Design patterns are recognized as a means to improve software maintenance by furnishing an explicit specification of class and object interactions and their underlying intent [Gamma et al. 1995]. Only a few empirical investigations have been conducted to assess whether the kind of documentation for design patterns implemented in source code affects its comprehensibility. To investigate this aspect, we conducted a family of four controlled experiments with 88 participants having different experience (i.e., professionals and Bachelor, Master, and PhD students). In each experiment, the participants were divided into three groups and asked to comprehend a nontrivial chunk of an open-source software system. Depending on the group, each participant was, or was not, provided with graphical or textual representations of the design patterns implemented within the source code. We graphically documented design-pattern instances with UML class diagrams. Textually documented instances are directly reported source code as comments. Our results indicate that documenting design-pattern instances yields an improvement in correctness of understanding source code for those participants with an adequate level of experience.

273	OODP	Does OO sync with how we think?	Of the many revolutions that have captured the hearts of programmers, object orientation has been arguably the most forceful and alluring. Central to the paradigm is that it matches how we think about the world and therefore self-evidently points the way for all future development. Given that corrective-maintenance costs already dominate the software life cycle and look set to increase significantly, I argue that reliability in the form of reducing such costs is the most important software improvement goal. Yet, as I will show, the results are not promising when we review recent corrective-maintenance data for big systems in general and for OO systems, in this case written in C++. I assert that any paradigm that is capable of decomposing a system into large numbers of small components - as frequently occurs in both OO and conventional systems - is fundamentally wrong. Thus, because both paradigms suffer from this flaw, we should expect no particular benefits to accrue from an OO system over a non-OO system. Further, a detailed comparison of OO programming and the human thought processes involved in short- and long-term memory suggests that OO aligns with human thinking limitations indifferently at best. In the case studies I describe, OO is no more than a different paradigm, and emphatically not a better one, although it is not possible to apportion blame between the OO paradigm itself and its C++implementation.

274	OODP	Dynamic Aspects Weaving in Service Composition	Web service composition is to construct complex service through combining available services components as request. A service component is a self-contained unit of service construction that provides an identifiable and distinct part of a service with well-defined interface. For example, to assure the security of Web service, both the service provider and requestor should take account of the security control. But the implementation of crosscutting concerns, such as security control, will scatter in multiple components. In this paper we adopt the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) to separate security control from other functional requirements. AOP is a new software development paradigm that aims to increase comprehensibility, adaptability, and reusability by introducing aspect to modularize the crosscutting concerns. Any behavior associated to several components is encapsulated into an aspect. In our work, the composition is extended by weaving extension at running time. It makes the service composition more flexible and gives the composer a chance to unify security policy in composed service by specifying appropriate security extension himself. This paper also presents an infrastructure to demonstrate how dynamic weaving of aspects can be used to enhance the security of service composition. An application of performing user-defined access control dynamically at run-time is given to exemplify the dynamic extension to service composition	Weaving; Web services; Security; Educational institutions; Mechanical engineering; Service oriented architecture; Dynamic programming; Scattering; Functional programming; Access control; Weaving; Running Time; Web Server; Access Control; Security Policy; Composers; Service Components; Security Control; Complex Service; Business Processes; Software Architecture; Digital Signature; Simulation Applications; Service Registry; Joint Point	Haitao Song; Yingyu Yin; Shixiong Zheng	Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications	https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDA.2006.137	"1.T.

276	OODP	Dynamic multi-agent architecture using conversational role delegation	This paper discusses the notions of dynamic composition and dynamic architectures, in the context of conversational multi-agents systems, as well as distributed component oriented or object based systems. The directory service or facilitator agent paradigm, commonly used for building architectures exhibiting these properties, is examined and discussed. It is then compared with a proposed alternative paradigm, based on dynamic conversational role delegation. It is shown that the directory service paradigm, among other weaknesses, exposes the system to synchronization problems when complex protocols are used or concurrent access to the directory are involved, and is not transparent. The role delegation paradigm, on the other hand, presents significant advantages, including a better synchronization with ongoing conversations, and allows transparent encapsulation of the compositional behavior. A working prototype, focused on electronic auction and on-the-fly protocol adaptation, through adaptation proxies, is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

277	OODP	Dynamic Routing as paradigm for decentralized flexible process management	Since companies face continuously changing business processes, centralized process repositories and execution engines have been integrated into the heart of enterprise systems. These systems are then able to support repetitive processes. In order to extend the reach of process orientation into more collaborative settings, employees must be given the possibility to adapt and refine the processes to their individual needs. Personalized process templates are applied to tasks and running process instances are subject to massive changes by the participants. These flexible processes require for process management infrastructures of a more peer to peer style. We argue that the concept of Dynamic Routing is a valuable paradigm for supporting highly flexible processes. We identified three patterns for Dynamic Routing and sketch future enterprise system architectures implementing these. We present two case studies where dynamically routed interactions are at the center of attention.

279	OODP	Early algorithm efficiency with design patterns	Algorithm efficiency is a fundamental computer science concept encapsulating the core topic of algorithm complexity. While complexity is expressed in formal measures such as 'Big O', efficiency can be denoted in rather flexible terms. Thus, unlike complexity, which is postponed in the introduction of programming (due to its formal measures), efficiency can be introduced early. Unfortunately, the strong link between efficiency and complexity yields a delayed introduction of efficiency. This is unnecessary and results in reduced student perspective of basic programming considerations. I present an Efficiency-Early Approach in which efficiency of algorithms is introduced early, gradually, using simple measuring terms. The approach emphasizes capitalization on problem characteristics and utilization of design patterns. I illustrate the approach with gradually-more-subtle algorithmic tasks, and assess different levels of their solutions. The more advanced tasks are colorful and rather unfamiliar. The different solution levels represent results I experienced in implementing the approach with highschool computer science students. The implementation raised student awareness of problem characteristics, augmented their design pattern repertoires, and enhanced their efficiency perspective. Improvement in mathematical insight was experienced with the average and better students.

281	OODP	Efficient and extensible multithreaded remote servers	In many cases, servers must impose a protocol of calls to their clients, and at the same time handle multiple client requests. The MT-Rendezvous design pattern greatly simplifies both tasks: separate server threads handle separate clients or sessions, and each different call protocol is handled by means of rendezvous. One of the most significant performance problems in this kind of system is the latency introduced by network messages exchanged between clients and servers. Another design pattern, CompositeCalls, has been used to achieve dramatic performance improvements. With CompositeCalls clients send entire programs to the server so that the number of messages exchanged can be greatly reduced. Moreover, servers can be dynamically extended by using CompositeCalls. Therefore, an expressive and efficient server model can be obtained by mixing both patterns within the same framework. However, as both patterns overlap, its integration is not a trivial task. In this paper we describe how can both patterns be combined, including a brief description for its instantiation in Ada 95. Besides, we show concrete applications where the compound pattern, CompositeRendezvousCalls, can be employed, including a transactional framework for distributed Ada applications, TransLib.

282	OODP	Empirical comparison of two metrics suites for maintainability prediction in packages of object-oriented systems: A case study of open source software	Software maintainability has been an important external quality attribute that concerns both styles of software development, the proprietary model as well as open source. As lots of open source software are predominantly built using the OO paradigm, there exists a need for empirical validation with respect to certain quality aspects especially maintainability. There are a few studies in the past which use code metrics and a few which use design metrics, much earlier in the software development life cycle to predict maintainability. In addition, there are studies which apply both code as well as design metrics to evaluate maintainability. The objective of this research is to perform an empirical comparison of two popular OO metrics suites, the Martin suite and the CK suite on four open source software systems by analysing a few key design metrics such as size, coupling, complexity, inheritance and stability. Two important observations were made with this empirical study. First, between the two OO suite of design metrics, the prediction model developed using Martin metrics scores better than the model developed using the CK suite. Second, the combination of Martin and CK suites is helpful in predicting the maintainability of OO software, with a predictive accuracy of 66.7%, better than that of the models constructed by either Martin metrics or by the CK metrics individually.

283	OODP	Empirical Investigation of the Impact of the Adapter Design Pattern on Software Maintainability	Design patterns have a key role in software development process. However, their impact on software quality is not well investigated. There is no common agreement on how design patterns impact software quality. This paper aims to empirically investigate whether the Adapter design pattern impacts software maintainability positively or negatively. To achieve this aim, refactoring techniques have been applied to generate a non-pattern version for four subject systems. Then, software metrics have been calculated and compared for both versions; the pattern version and non-pattern version. The correlation of software metrics to software maintainability have been used and adopted from previous research studies. The empirical results show that the Adapter pattern versions have a better software metrics than do the non-Adapter pattern versions i.e. a sign that the Adapter design pattern impacts software maintainability positively.

284	OODP	Enabling better research through a new paradigm for access and usability of atmospheric science data	With emergence of better technology, the rate of data gathering has grown enormously. However, technology has not been fully exploited in the scientific data analysis process. There are obstacles in data preprocessing that the scientists need to overcome before proceeding with the analysis. The first obstacle is designing and developing the preprocessing algorithms for the data sets required for their study. Most data archiving centers provide search and access capabilities for locating and retrieving data. However, these centers do not provide preprocessing algorithms that a scientist could utilize for data preparation and transformation. This leads to redundancy of time and effort as multiple scientists using the same data set end up developing the same preprocessing algorithms. The second major preprocessing obstacle faced by the scientists is data in the different variety of formats. Unfortunately in atmospheric science, there is no single standard data format. Data created by different centers or scientists can be created in numerous formats. This leads to the dat-/application interoperability problem where an application cannot utilize data in a different data format. Moreover, some of these formats can be complex and require a great deal of effort to decode. This investigation looked at solutions to solve these two problems. The solution for providing preprocessing capabilities to scientists is to encapsulate the required algorithms along with the data as an Intelligent Data Object. These objects then can be used through their set of interfaces to invoke processing algorithms. A prototype Data Ordering System built on this concept is demonstrated in this study. An interchange technology is researched as a solution for the data/application interoperability problem. This interchange technology consisting of Markup files and an associated library provide an elegant solution to this problem. Detailed procedures for utilizing this interchange technology for atmospheric science data sets were compiled in this study. This research also compared these two solutions against other approaches taken by different researchers. ProQuest Subject Headings: Geophysics.

285	OODP	Enabling through life product-instance management: Solutions and challenges	Developments in the area of radio frequency identification (RFID) and sensor network technologies have created new possibilities for product lifecycle management (PLM). These technologies are enabling building blocks upon which various business applications for product management can be built. A significant aspect in the through-life management of products is the gathering and management of data related to the product during the various phases of its lifecycle. Both RFID and wireless sensor technologies have created novel levels of product status visibility and automatic identification with granularity to the level of individual components. We consider three approaches that leverage automatic identification technologies and miniaturised wireless sensors to support PLM strategies at the product instance level based on a product centric computing paradigm. The paper draws upon a number of case studies focusing on the various phases of a product's lifecycle: Beginning of Life, Middle of Life and End of Life. We used the case studies to extract technical, capability and information requirements needed to support PLM strategies. We compared the ability and suitability of existing architectural approaches to meet the key requirements we identified. Furthermore we assessed them to evaluate their level of support for managing product instances at different lifecycle phases. Finally, we present an extension to significantly improve the ability of the most promising architecture for supporting PLM strategies.

287	OODP	Enhancing agent mediated electronic markets with ontology matching services and social network support	In agent mediated electronic commerce the diversity of the involved actors can lead to diff erent conceptualizations of their needs and capabilities giving rise to semantic incompatibilities that might hamper negotiations and the fulfilling of satisfactory transactions. In order to provide help in the conversation among diff erent agents, these systems should provide ontology services, more specifically, ontology matching services. However, given the natural ambiguity of the ontology matching process, raising the possibility of multiple alignments between the same pair of ontologies, it is necessary to choose the one that best meets the interests of both agents. On the other hand, agents may possess diff erent interests, therefore the ontology alignment may also become the object of further negotiation. In this context, the application and exploitation of relationships captured in social networks can result in the establishment of more accurate adequacy relations of ontology alignments to agents, as well as the improvement of the negotiations' efficiency and, consequently, the users' satisfaction with the electronic commerce system. In this paper we present the AEMOS system which follows an ontology-based information integration approach, exploiting the ontology matching paradigm, improved by the application and exploitation of the relationships captured in the social networks.

288	OODP	Enterprise modelling with FUNSOFT nets	In this article we propose workflow techniques such as FUNSOFT for the specification of ODP Enterprise Models. Workflow-orientation as one of the most popular management paradigms and object-orientation as the state of the art software development paradigm will be integrated in the ODP framework. Our example is related to our experience in the air traffic control application domain and will demonstrate how a workflow related development perspective embedded in the ODP framework can improve the system integration on one hand and will guarantee user participation at the same time.

Workflow-orientation as one of the most popular management paradigms and object-orientation as the state of the art software development paradigm will be integrated in the ODP framework. Our example is related to our experience in the air traffic control application domain and will demonstrate how a workflow related development perspective embedded in the ODP framework can improve the system integration on one hand and will guarantee user participation at the same time.

289	OODP	Ergonomics-Inspired Reshaping and Exploration of Collections of Models	This paper examines the following question: given a collection of man-made shapes, e.g., chairs, can we effectively explore and rank the shapes with respect to a given human body - in terms of how well a candidate shape fits the specified human body? Answering this question requires identifying which shapes are more suitable for a prescribed body, and how to alter the input geometry to better fit the shapes to a given human body. The problem links physical proportions of the human body and its interaction with object geometry, which is often expressed as ergonomics guidelines. We present an interactive system that allows users to explore shapes using different avatar poses, while, at the same time providing interactive previews of how to alter the shapes to fit the user-specified body and pose. We achieve this by first constructing a fuzzy shape-to-body map from the ergonomic guidelines to multi-contacts geometric constraints; and then, proposing a novel contact-preserving deformation paradigm to realize a reshaping to adapt the input shape. We evaluate our method on collections of models from different categories and validate the results through a user study.

291	OODP	Evaluating ADELFE methodology in the requirements identification	The increasing use of multi-agent systems brings challenges that have not been studied yet, such as how should we adapt requirements elicitation to cope with agent properties like autonomy, sociability and proactiveness. Many methodologies were proposed adopting this new paradigm. However, most of them are still in their early phases and therefore need to be adapted. In this work ADELFE, an agent-oriented methodology is evaluated. We use an exemplar proposed in 2001 by Yu and Cysneiros [1] to evaluate both agent/goal orientation and object orientation. This evaluation aims at analysing the strengths and weaknesses of ADELFE through the methodologies questions proposed in the exemplar.

293	OODP	Evaluating the Impact of Design Patterns on Software Maintainability: An Empirical Evaluation	Software maintainability is a critical quality attribute that refers to the efforts required to perform specific changes to the software after deployment. This research aims to prove that the effective use of design patterns leads to a better software maintainability value by empirically evaluating a simpler solution (a solution without applying design patterns) with its refined version (after applying appropriate design patterns). A scenario is used in the paper to generate two working solutions to evaluate both of their maintainability values and justify how the use of design patterns on the refined solution has significantly improved the quality of the software. Furthermore, a critical analysis is performed to compare the results of the refined solution with its equivalent simpler solution. The result of the empirical evaluation indicates that the use of design patterns brought significant improvement to the solution in reducing the complexity and improving the maintainability of the solution.

294	OODP	Evaluation of accuracy in design pattern occurrence detection	Detection of design pattern occurrences is part of several solutions to software engineering problems, and high accuracy of detection is important to help solve the actual problems. The improvement in accuracy of design pattern occurrence detection requires some way of evaluating various approaches. Currently, there are several different methods used in the community to evaluate accuracy. We show that these differences may greatly influence the accuracy results, which makes it nearly impossible to compare the quality of different techniques. We propose a benchmark suite to improve the situation and a community effort to contribute to, and evolve, the benchmark suite. Also, we propose fine-grained metrics assessing the accuracy of various approaches in the benchmark suite.

296	OODP	Evaluation of object-oriented reflective models	Reflection is a suitable paradigm for developing open systems.

297	OODP	Evaluation of the notification oriented paradigm applied to sentient computing	The Notification-Oriented Paradigm (NOP)defines a new approach for conception, structuring, and execution of software leading to performance improvements, organization of causal knowledge, and decoupling of programming entities when compared to standard solutions based upon current paradigms, such as the Imperative Paradigm (IP) and the Declarative Paradigm (DP). These paradigms present drawbacks such as waste of processing capacity and coupling among entities, due to their orientation to a monolithic inference mechanism that is based on causal evaluation implemented by means of searches over passive computational entities. The NOP, however, proposes a different approach of structuring software and realization of its inferences, which are based upon small, smart, and decoupled collaborative entities that interact by means of precise notifications. In this way, NOP achieves responsiveness, distributiveness, consistency, and robustness. These features are among the demands of Sentient Computing that combines ubiquitous and 'traditional' computing providing monitoring actuation on a given environment. This paper analyzes the NOP applicability to Sentient Computing by confronting the demands of the latter with the characteristics of the former. As conclusion, the NOP is considered applicable to this sort of computational system.

298	OODP	Experience using design patterns to evolve communication software across diverse OS platforms	Design patterns help to improve communication software quality since they address a fundamental challenge in large-scale software development: communication of architectural knowledge among developers. This paper makes several contributions to the study and practice of design patterns. It presents a case study that illustrates how design patterns helped to reduce development effort and project risk when evolving an object-oriented telecommunication software framework across UNIX and Windows NT OS platforms. Second, the paper discusses the techniques, benefits, and limitations of applying a design pattern-based reuse strategy to commercial telecommunication software systems.		Schmidt, D.

299	OODP	Experience with distributed objects in a portable and multithreaded library for a LAN/WAN gateway application	Design of a multithreaded, object oriented C+ + class library for a simple LAN/WAN gateway application is described. The design supports both the algorithm used in various existing commercial products and another simple and enhanced algorithm. The design takes advantage of the inheritance and polymorphism properties of the object oriented paradigm, is based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), and is expressed in terms of a portable, heterogeneous set of port objects. The multithreaded performance is modelled, and is compared to long duration observed values. RPC environments are becoming widespread, but their application-level performance characteristics are not well-understood. This experiment is one of the first such reported for object-oriented RPC environments. Instructive observations, based on this experience, about the library and concurrent RPC performance modelling technique are presented.

The design supports both the algorithm used in various existing commercial products and another simple and enhanced algorithm. The design takes advantage of the inheritance and polymorphism properties of the object oriented paradigm, is based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), and is expressed in terms of a portable, heterogeneous set of port objects. The multithreaded performance is modelled, and is compared to long duration observed values. RPC environments are becoming widespread, but their application-level performance characteristics are not well-understood. This experiment is one of the first such reported for object-oriented RPC environments. Instructive observations, based on this experience, about the library and concurrent RPC performance modelling technique are presented."",

300	OODP	Explorative process design patterns	The dominating process lifecycle models are characterized by deductive reasoning; that is, during the process analysis stage, problem-centered approaches such as Lean's seven types of waste are used to identify pain points (e.g., bottlenecks), and defined response patterns are deployed to overcome these. As a result, exploitative business process management (BPM) has reached a high level of maturity. However, explorative BPM, with its focus on adding new value to business processes, lacks an equally mature, deductive set of design patterns. This paper proposes to close this gap by offering seven explorative process design patterns that support the identification of options to create new value from existing business processes. Derived from secondary data analysis, the patterns are presented and comprehensively exemplified. Contributing these seven types of process exploration has the potential to help complement the focus on operationally excellent processes with a view on revenue-resilient business processes.

It discusses how using the aspect-oriented paradigm, in addition to the object-oriented programming paradigm, affects students' programs, their exam results, and their overall perception of the theoretically claimed benefits of aspect-oriented programming. The research methodology, consisting of automating the analysis of student-created computer programs, administering surveys, and collecting exam results, provided an objective measurement of the benefits of the paradigm for novice programmers, as well as evaluating their perception of its usefulness. The results show that the use of aspect-oriented programming as a supplement to object-oriented programming enhances the productivity of novice program code software engineering students and leads to increased understanding of theoretical concepts.

304	OODP	Extragalactic radio-source evolution under the dual-population unification scheme	We show that a dual-population unification scheme provides a successful paradigm with which to describe the evolution and beaming of all bright extragalactic radio sources. The paradigm consists of two intrinsic radio-source populations, based on the two distinct radio-galaxy morphologies of Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classes I and II. These represent the 'unbeamed' or 'side-on' parent populations of steep radio spectra; the 'beamed' source types, including flat-spectrum quasars and BL Lac objects, arise through the random alignment of their radio axis to our line of sight where Doppler beaming of the relativistic radio jets produces highly anisotropic radio emission. We develop the model in two stages. In the first stage the source space density as a function of cosmic epoch is determined for the two parent populations, and for this we use low-frequency source-count and identification data to avoid biases due to Doppler-enhanced radio emission. The second stage defines the beaming models for each population, using high-frequency survey data and in particular the 5-GHz source count in which at high flux densities the flat- and steep-spectrum sources contribute in similar measures. We assume that the flat-spectrum objects, quasars and BL Lac objects are 'beamed' versions of FR I and FR II objects in which the close alignment of the radio axis with the line of sight has changed the radio appearance into a core-dominated (flat-spectrum) object. We adopt a simple parametrization of the beaming, orient the parent populations at random with a Monte Carlo process, and use a minimization process to determine beaming parameters that yield a best fit to the 5-GHz source count. The best-fitting parameters are found to be in good agreement with those measured observationally for individual radio sources.

    abstract = ""We show that a dual-population unification scheme provides a successful paradigm with which to describe the evolution and beaming of all bright extragalactic radio sources. The paradigm consists of two intrinsic radio-source populations, based on the two distinct radio-galaxy morphologies of Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classes I and II. These represent the 'unbeamed' or 'side-on' parent populations of steep radio spectra; the 'beamed' source types, including flat-spectrum quasars and BL Lac objects, arise through the random alignment of their radio axis to our line of sight where Doppler beaming of the relativistic radio jets produces highly anisotropic radio emission. We develop the model in two stages. In the first stage the source space density as a function of cosmic epoch is determined for the two parent populations, and for this we use low-frequency source-count and identification data to avoid biases due to Doppler-enhanced radio emission. The second stage defines the beaming models for each population, using high-frequency survey data and in particular the 5-GHz source count in which at high flux densities the flat- and steep-spectrum sources contribute in similar measures. We assume that the flat-spectrum objects, quasars and BL Lac objects are 'beamed' versions of FR I and FR II objects in which the close alignment of the radio axis with the line of sight has changed the radio appearance into a core-dominated (flat-spectrum) object. We adopt a simple parametrization of the beaming, orient the parent populations at random with a Monte Carlo process, and use a minimization process to determine beaming parameters that yield a best fit to the 5-GHz source count. The best-fitting parameters are found to be in good agreement with those measured observationally for individual radio sources. In this, the model accurately reproduces the change in source-count form with frequency. Indeed the unified-scheme paradigm has great predictive power, and we show how the model successfully describes several additional and independent data sets."",

305	OODP	Fast human-computer interaction by combining gaze pointing and Face gestures	In this work, we show how our open source accessibility software, the FaceSwitch, can help motor-impaired subjects to efficiently interact with a computer hands-free. The FaceSwitch enhances gaze interaction with video-based face gestures interaction. The emerging multimodal system allows for interaction with a user interface by means of gaze pointing for target selection and facial gestures for target-specific action commands. The FaceSwitch maps facial gestures to specific mouse or keyboard events such as: left mouse click, right mouse click, or page scroll down. Hence, facial gestures serve the purpose of mechanical switches.With this multimodal interaction paradigm, the user gazes at the object in the user interface with which it wants to interact and then triggers a target-specific action by performing a face gesture. Through a rigorous user study, we have obtained quantitative evidence that suggests our proposed interaction paradigm improves the performance of traditional accessibility options, such as gaze-only interaction or gaze with a single mechanical switch interaction while coming close in terms of speed and accuracy with traditional mouse-based interaction.Wemake the FaceSwitch software freely available to the community so the output of our research can help the target audience.

306	OODP	Filters as a language support for design patterns in object-oriented scripting languages	Scripting languages are designed for glueing software components together. Such languages provide features like dynamic extensibility and dynamic typing with automatic conversion that make them well suited for rapid application development. Although these features entail runtime penalties, modern CPUs are fast enough to execute even large applications in scripting languages efficiently. Large applications typically entail complex program structures. Object-orientation offers the means to solve some of the problems caused by this complexity, but focuses only on entities up to the size of a single class. The object-oriented design community proposes design patterns as a solution for complex interactions that are poorly supported by current object-oriented programming languages. In order to use patterns in an application, their implementation has to be scattered over several classes. This fact makes patterns hard to locate in the actual code and complicates their maintenance in an application. This paper presents a general approach to combine the ideas of scripting and object-orientation in a way that preserves the benefits of both of them. It describes the object-oriented scripting language XOTcl (Extended OTCL), which is equipped with several language functionalities that help in the implementation of design patterns. We introduce the filter approach which provides a novel, intuitive, and powerful language support for the instantiation of large program structures like design patterns.

307	OODP	Fine-grained software metrics in practice	Modularity is one of the key features of the Object-Oriented (OO) paradigm. Low coupling and high cohesion help to achieve good modularity. Inheritance is one of the core concepts of the OO paradigm which facilitates modularity. Previous research has shown that the use of the friend construct as a coupling mechanism in C++ software is extensive. However, measures of the friend construct are scarse in comparison with measures of inheritance. In addition, these existing measures are coarse-grained, in spite of the widespread use of the friend mechanism. In this paper, a set of software metrics are proposed that measure the actual use of the friend construct, inheritance and other forms of coupling. These metrics are based on the interactions for which each coupling mechanism is necessary and sufficient. Previous work only considered the declaration of a relationship between classes. The software metrics introduced are empirically assessed using the LEDA software system. Our results indicate that the friend mechanism is used to a very limited extent to access hidden methods in classes. However, access to hidden attributes is more common.

309	OODP	Formal models of object-oriented patterns using RTPA	The development of generically reusable object-oriented components is a task with a higher degree of cognitive complexity. Design patterns are an important means to deal with this difficulty for capturing design notions and recurrent architectures in software engineering. Since patterns are inherently complicated, the conventional diagram-based techniques cannot rigorously and explicitly denote the architectures and behaviors of patterns. Real-Time Process Algebra (RTPA) is used to describe software patterns formally and explicitly in order to enhance the understandability of their architectures, semantics, and behaviors. This paper presents a formal model of generic patterns, which focuses on architectural and associational descriptions of a pattern's interfaces, implementation, and instantiations.

Design patterns are an important means to deal with this difficulty for capturing design notions and recurrent architectures in software engineering. Since patterns are inherently complicated, the conventional diagram-based techniques cannot rigorously and explicitly denote the architectures and behaviors of patterns. Real-Time Process Algebra (RTPA) is used to describe software patterns formally and explicitly in order to enhance the understandability of their architectures, semantics, and behaviors. This paper presents a formal model of generic patterns, which focuses on architectural and associational descriptions of a pattern's interfaces, implementation, and instantiations.

311	OODP	Formalizing design patterns	Design patterns facilitate reuse of good design practices. They are typically given by using conventional notations that lack well-defined semantics and, therefore reasoning about their behaviors requires formalization. Even when formalized, conventional communication abstractions may lead to too laborious formalizations when addressing the temporal behavior of a pattern as a whole instead of behaviors local to its components. We show that rigorous reasoning can be eased by formalizing temporal behaviors of patterns in terms of high-level abstractions of communication, and that by using property-preserving refinements, specifications can be naturally composed by using patterns as building blocks.

312	OODP	Foundations of logic-based trust management	Over the last 15 years, many policy languages have been developed for specifying policies and credentials under the trust management paradigm. What has been missing is a formal semantics - in particular, one that would capture the inherently dynamic nature of trust management, where access decisions are based on the local policy in conjunction with varying sets of dynamically submitted credentials. The goal of this paper is to rest trust management on a solid formal foundation. To this end, we present a model theory that is based on Kripke structures for counterfactual logic. The semantics enjoys compositionality and full abstraction with respect to a natural notion of observational equivalence between trust management policies. Furthermore, we present a corresponding Hilbert-style axiomatization that is expressive enough for reasoning about a system's observables on the object level. We describe an implementation of a mechanization of the proof theory, which can be used to prove non-trivial meta-theorems about trust management systems, as well as analyze probing attacks on such systems. Our benchmark results show that this logic-based approach performs significantly better than the only previously available, ad-hoc analysis method for probing attacks.

313	OODP	FPDB4O: A fuzzy and probabilistic object base management system	For modelling real-world problems and constructing intelligent systems, integration of different methodologies and techniques has been the quest and focus of significant interdisciplinary research effort. The advantages of such a hybrid system are that the strengths of its partners are combined and complementary to each other's weakness. However, extended object-oriented models that combine the relevance and strength of both fuzzy set theory and probability theory appear to be sporadic. Furthermore, the soft computing paradigm needs to have real systems implemented to be useful in practice. This paper presents our development of FPDB4O as a management system for fuzzy and probabilistic object bases of the model called FPOB. The syntax and semantics of FPOB schemas, instances, and selection operation are summarized. Then the implementation of those features in FPDB4O is presented.

The advantages of such a hybrid system are that the strengths of its partners are combined and complementary to each other's weakness. However, extended object-oriented models that combine the relevance and strength of both fuzzy set theory and probability theory appear to be sporadic. Furthermore, the soft computing paradigm needs to have real systems implemented to be useful in practice. This paper presents our development of FPDB4O as a management system for fuzzy and probabilistic object bases of the model called FPOB. The syntax and semantics of FPOB schemas, instances, and selection operation are summarized. Then the implementation of those features in FPDB4O is presented. (c) 2007 IEEE."",

314	OODP	Framework component systems: Concepts, design heuristics, and perspectives	An appropriate combination of object-oriented programming concepts allows not only the development of single reusable components but also of semifinished architectures (frameworks). The paper first discusses the concepts underlying frameworks and goes on to present design heuristics for developing such component architectures. Though design patterns are currently heralded as state-of-the-art in supporting framework development, a link between design patterns that capture and communicate proven object-oriented design and the framework development process is still missing. As a pragmatic solution to this problem we introduce so-called hot spot cards to bridge the mentioned gap. These hot spot cards prove to be a valuable communication vehicle between domain experts and software engineers and thus help to reduce the number of framework design iterations. We sketch the perspectives and implications of framework technology.		Pree, W. (1); Pomberger, G. (1); Kapsner, F.	Perspectives of System Informatics.

316	OODP	Frameworks for designing and implementing dependable systems using Coordinated Atomic Actions: A comparative study	This paper1Some preliminary results included in this paper were presented at 17th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE'06) (see Capozucca et al., 2006).1 presents ways of implementing dependable distributed applications designed using the Coordinated Atomic Action (CAA) paradigm. CAAs provide a coherent set of concepts adapted to fault tolerant distributed system design that includes structured transactions, distribution, cooperation, competition, and forward and backward error recovery mechanisms triggered by exceptions. DRIP (Dependable Remote Interacting Processes) is an efficient Java implementation framework which provides support for implementing Dependable Multiparty Interactions (DMI). As DMIs have a softer exception handling semantics compared with the CAA semantics, a CAA design can be implemented using the DRIP framework. A new framework called CAA-DRIP allows programmers to exclusively implement the semantics of CAAs using the same terminology and concepts at the design and implementation levels. The new framework not only simplifies the implementation phase, but also reduces the final system size as it requires less number of instances for creating a CAA at runtime. The paper analyses both implementation frameworks in great detail, drawing a systematic comparison of the two. The CAAs behaviour is described in terms of Statecharts to better understand the differences between the two frameworks. Based on the results of the comparison, we use one of the frameworks to implement a case study belonging to the e-health domain.

317	OODP	From C to C++: code recycling in practice	ANSI-C is contained in C++ as a subset, which has the disadvantage that the OO (Object Orientated) paradigm in C++ can not be assured. On the other hand, it has the advantage that the transition to an OO-paradigm can be progressive, allowing existing programs and program modules to be used (sliding transition). Interaction between C and C++ components is explained and the motivation for a hybrid language such as C++, based on OO principles, is considered. The use of constructs and destructs is explored and the advantages of object orientation are stated, allowing old C code to be cleaned up by removing non-C++ parts. The training of programmers in C++ is discussed.		Weitzel, M.	OOP'97.

319	OODP	From object-oriented programming to service-oriented computing: How to improve interoperability by preserving subtyping	The object-oriented paradigm is increasingly used in the implementation and the use of web services. However, the mismatch between objects and document structures in the wire has a negative impact over interoperability, more particularly when subtyping is involved. In this paper, we discuss how to improve interoperability in this context by preserving the subsumption property associated to subtyping.

320	OODP	From software architecture to design patterns: A case study of an NFR approach	There has been extensive research on establishing a non-functional requirement (NFR) framework [3] and applying it systematically in selecting software architectural design alternatives. However there is still a gap between software architecture and concrete detailed design. This paper presents a way to come up with more detailed designs by selecting a set of applicable design patterns. The method in selecting design patterns will be applied step by step systematically in a defined process. After a preliminary selection of a set of potentially applicable design patterns based on existing knowledge, analysis of their applicability is conducted on each of the design patterns. In each analysis process, the potentially applicable design pattern and the chosen architectural design are decomposed; the traceability from software architecture to design patterns is analyzed. This method is applied in the case study on keyword in context system (KWIC) [2] [3]. The notation of NFR approach [4] is further refined.

322	OODP	Generally covariant N-particle dynamics	A simultaneous description of the dynamics of multiple particles requires a configuration space approach with an external time parameter. This is in stark contrast with the relativistic paradigm, where time is but a coordinate chosen by an observer. Here we show, however, that the two attitudes towards modelling N-particle dynamics can be conciliated within a generally covariant framework. To this end we construct an 'N-particle configuration spacetime' M(N), starting from a globally hyperbolic spacetime M with a chosen smooth splitting into time and space components. The dynamics of multi-particle systems is modelled at the level of Borel probability measures over M(N) with the help of the global time parameter. We prove that with any time-evolution of measures, which respects the N-particle causal structure of M(N), one can associate a single measure on the Polish space of 'N-particle wordlines'. The latter is a splitting-independent object, from which one can extract the evolution of measures for any other global observer on M. An additional asset of the adopted measure-theoretic framework is the possibility to model the dynamics of indistinguishable entities, such as quantum particles. As an application we show that the multi-photon and multi-fermion Schrodinger equations, although explicitly dependent on the choice of an external time-parameter, are in fact fully compatible with the causal structure of the Minkowski spacetime.

323	OODP	Generation of Independent Contact Regions on objects reconstructed from noisy real-world range data	The synthesis and evaluation of multi-fingered grasps on complex objects is a challenging problem that has received much attention in the robotics community. Although several promising approaches have been developed, applications to real-world systems are limited to simple objects or gripper configurations. The paradigm of Independent Contact Regions (ICRs) has been proposed as a way to increase the tolerance to grasp positioning errors. This concept is well established, though only on precise geometric object models. This work is concerned with the application of the ICR paradigm to models reconstructed from real-world range data.

Although several promising approaches have been developed, applications to real-world systems are limited to simple objects or gripper configurations. The paradigm of Independent Contact Regions (ICRs) has been proposed as a way to increase the tolerance to grasp positioning errors. This concept is well established, though only on precise geometric object models. This work is concerned with the application of the ICR paradigm to models reconstructed from real-world range data.

325	OODP	GQM-based Tree Model for Automatic Recommendation of Design Pattern Category	Software Design Patterns (DP) are formal approaches that propose generic reusable solutions to different design problems. Building DP automatic recommendation system is one of the most challenging topics in the field of software industry to improve the final software quality. Proposing a DP for a design problem requires good base knowledge about each DP and its functionality. In this paper, we propose an approach that automatically recommends the appropriate design pattern category. The proposed approach is a Goal Question Metric (GQM) based tree model of questions. The software engineer answers these questions based on the user requirements, and finally the approach recommends the category of the suitable DP category based on our designed tree model. The GQM is responsible for weight calculation process at each node based on the questions' answers. The software engineer is responsible for delivering the user requirements to our system, via answering the proposed model. The precision and accuracy obtained by our system is 80\% while the recall is 100\%.

Structured models improve comprehension, reduce design and composition errors, whilst the gradual nature proposed, allows the modeller to choose what best fits their requirements.

327	OODP	Graphs versus objects: practical programming of knowledge-rich applications for Web 2.0 and beyond	Software objects are the de facto programming paradigm for engineering intelligence into modern computer systems. Objects' labyrinth of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulated data, intermeshed with ifs, whiles, and for loops, are the basis for flying airplanes, producing health diagnoses, and surfing the Web. Sometimes we escape this rigid paradigm and place the program intelligence elsewhere, such as databases and files. In most cases, knowledge solutions are a hybrid of approaches. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. An alternative approach-graphs-offers a contrast to these traditional holders of programming intelligence. Graphs have improved significantly with the coming of the semantic Web, where graphs are a key tenet. In this article, we introduce graphs through a comparison with objects. This approach illustrates some key advantages while stirring up a little controversy. Some would say we should start with comparing graphs to databases and other similar approaches, but this would constrain graphs to a more traditional role. Graphs, as you will see, can help in all areas of knowledge management, including Web 2.0 and beyond.		Hebeler, J.; Fisher, M.

Although the collaboration can be achieved using a Collaborative Robot in a purposely designed workstation, this solution is not always neither feasible nor affordable for the specific task to be carried out in the workstation. On the other hand, using a smart HMI to make an industrial robot a ""smart"" robot can be a better and affordable solution depending on the task. In this work we present the preliminary development and characteristics of an experimental HMI for smart manufacturing developed in MATLAB and ROS Industrial. The collaboration between humans and robots is achieved by leveraging the Faster R-CNN Object Detector to robustly detect and recognize the hand gestures performed in real-time.

329	OODP	Hexagon-diamond grid system for motion tracking	Based on the block-matching motion vector estimation techniques, a grid system using the block-based technique is proposed for motion tracking in video sequences. The technique is known as hexagon-diamond grid system (HDGS). The HDGS has a large hexagon and small diamond search pattern based on block-matching motion tracking characteristics. The large hexagon search pattern will capture the motion in a particular block of the large region before the small diamond search pattern takes place. The small diamond design pattern is to provide accuracy and to obtain the best motion vector coordinate for motion tracking purposes. This motion vector coordinate can be used as a reference to track the motion in the images. The vector coordinate will determine whether the object is moving toward the horizontal or vertical plane. This will help to determine the region of interest to be examined based on the motion vector coordinate. Besides the motion vector measurement, the point signal noise-to-ratio (PSNR) is also applied to measure the quality of the video.

331	OODP	High performance distributed objects using distributed shared memory and remote method invocation	There are two emerging trends in distributed computing: the evolution of client/server architectures into multi-tiered systems and advances in distributed shared memory (DSM). The convergence of these two trends yields a new structure we call virtual distributed objects (VDOs). The first trend is evolving because of the difficulties involved in programming high-performance client/server applications. Client/server architectures must be designed from the ground-up for good performance. Increasingly, we are seeing new client/server topologies that improve server performance. The second converging trend associated with the transition from client/server to peer-to-peer distributed objects is the rapid advances in techniques for DSM. In the past, DSM has been used primarily for support of scientific applications. While DSM was once envisioned as a means to support an entire paged virtual address space, systems like Mirage and Mirage+ began support for sharing smaller entities called segments that, combined with RPCs (remote procedure calls) and RMIs (remote method invocations), can support VDOs. VDOs allow systems designers to improve system performance by making use of idle machines rather than requiring expensive upgrades to a server or extremely expensive upgrades to all client machines. We describe why high-performance VDOs will become the predominant paradigm for distributed computing in the next decade. We describe why VDOs, supported with DSM and other technologies, could potentially supplant strict client/server structures whose scalability and extensibility are inherently limited.

335	OODP	How to preserve the benefits of Design Patterns	The rapid evolution of Design Patterns has hampered the benefits gained from using Design Patterns. The increase in the number of Design Patterns makes a common vocabulary unmanageable, and the tracing problem obscures the documentation that should be enhanced by using Design Patterns. We present an analysis of Design Patterns that will strongly reduce the number of Fundamental Design Patterns and show how strong language abstractions can solve the tracing problem and thereby enhance the documentation.

336	OODP	How we got hooked on Eiffel	Eiffel combines all the positive characteristics of object-oriented programming. It has a powerful assertion specification capability and it automatically generates documentation. It also includes both type and semantic information extracted directly from the source code. Eiffel is a language that supports both the object-oriented paradigm and the realities of team-based software development. The Eiffel system performs automatic memory management and supports inheritance, assertions and generics. It uses natural language keywords instead of cryptic symbology and static typing not only provides Eiffel with improved documentation and compile-time error checking, but also promotes efficient compilation.

337	OODP	Hyperactive grey objects	"Previous papers on grey literature by the authors have described (1) the need for formal metadata to allow machine understanding and therefore scalable operations; (2) the enhancement of repositories of grey (and other) e-publications by linking with CRIS (Current Research Information Systems); (3) the use of the research process to collect metadata incrementally reducing the threshold barrier for end-users and improving quality in an ambient GRIDs environment. This paper takes the development one step further and proposes ""intelligent"" grey objects. The hypothesis is in 2 parts: (1) that the use of passive catalogs of metadata does not scale (a) in a highly distributed environment with millions of nodes and (b) with vastly increased volumes of R&D output grey publications with associated metadata; (2) that a new paradigm is required that (a) integrates grey with white literature and other R&D outputs such as software, data, products and patents (b) in a self-managing, self-optimizing way and that this paradigm manages automatically curation, provenance digital rights, trust, security and privacy. Concerning (1) existing repositories provide catalogs; harvesting takes increasing time ensuring non-currency. The end-user expends much manual effort/intelligence to utilize the results. The elapsed time of (1) the network (2) the centralized (or centrally controlled distributed) catalog server searches (3) end-user intervention becomes unacceptable. Concerning (2) there is no paradigm currently known to the authors that satisfies the requirement. Our proposal is outlined below. Hyperactive combines both hyperlinking and active properties of a (grey) object. Hyperlinking implies multimedia components linked to form the object and also external links to other resources. The term active implies that objects do not lie passively in a repository to be retrieved by end-users. They ""get a life"" and the object moves through the network knowing where it is going. A hyperactive grey object is wrapped by its (incrementally recorded) formal metadata and an associated (software) agent. It moves through process steps such as initial concept, authoring, reviewing and depositing in a repository. The workflow is based on the rules and information in the corporate data repository with which the agent interacts. Once the object is deposited, the agent associated with it actively pushes the object to the end-users (or systems) whose metadata indicate interest or an obligation in a workflowed process. The agents check the object and user (or system) metadata for rights, privacy, security parameters, and for any charges and assure compatibility. Alternatively the object can be found passively by end-user or system agents. The object can also associate itself with other objects forming relationships utilising metadata or content. Declared relationships include references and citations; workflowed relationships include versions and also links to corporate information and research datasets and software; inferenced relationships are discovered relationships such as between documents by different authors developed from an earlier idea of a third author. Components of this paradigm have been implemented to some extent. The challenge is implementing - respecting part two of the hypothesis - the integration architecture. This surely is harnessing the power of grey."

338	OODP	Identifying Software Complexity Topics with Latent Dirichlet Allocation on Design Patterns	The scientific literature has paid limited attention to studying software complexity subjects from the design point of view. There is a significant number of papers that study software complexity in relation with maintenance, refactoring, source code changes and that establish metrics for measuring software complexity. This paper compares design patterns and software complexity in order to identify trends of research in the software complexity area. For this purpose, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of software complexity scientific articles through the lens of design patterns. We have reviewed 1068 papers via latent Dirichlet allocation technique (LDA) for our work. We found that existing software complexity paths disproportionate emphasis in how software complexity could benefit from design patterns instead on how contributions to design patterns can benefit from software complexity.

339	OODP	Immutability and design patterns in Ruby	Functional Programming has seen a resurgence in interest in the last few years and is often mentioned in opposition to Object-Orientated Programming. However, Object-Orientated Programming can actually absorb some of the lessons of Functional Programming to improve performance and reliability. This paper examines three ways in which Immutability, a common Functional Programming technique, can be used to develop immutable objects in Ruby. B) 2021, CC BY.

340	OODP	Impact of the visitor pattern on program comprehension and maintenance	In the software engineering literature, many works claim that the use of design patterns improves the com-prehensibility of programs and, more generally, their maintainability. Yet, little work attempted to study the impact of design patterns on the developers' tasks of program comprehension and modification. We design and perform an experiment to collect data on the impact of the Visitor pattern on comprehension and modification tasks with class diagrams. We use an eye-tracker to register saccades and fixations, the latter representing the focus of the developers' attention. Collected data show that the Visitor pattern plays a role in maintenance tasks: class diagrams with its canonical representation requires less efforts from developers.

341	OODP	Implementation aspects of a recovery-based error estimator in finite element analysis	The paper is devoted to the use of error estimators based on gradient recovery in finite element computations, where the resulting error estimates can be used as the basis for hp-adaptive mesh refinement. Due to high complexity of adaptive numerical software we have decided to take advantage of the object-oriented paradigm of software development. We discuss our implementation of the Zienkiewicz-Zhu error estimator and of selected gradient recovery techniques (averaging and superconvergent patch recovery).

342	OODP	The design and implementation of a customizable fault tolerance framework	While there have been significant advances in fault tolerance research, the effort has focused on the design of individual fault-tolerant systems or methodologies. Recently, some research has been initiated to develop techniques that can provide a spectrum of fault tolerance capabilities. In this paper, we present the design of a fault tolerance framework that can support a wide range of applications with various fault tolerance requirements, various criticality levels, and various system models. The framework is designed to be parameterizable so that the user can configure it to obtain the desired features. Also, the framework is designed to be an off-the-shelf component such that application programs can be integrated within it easily to obtain the fault-tolerant version of the application system. A specialized N-modular redundancy (SNMR) scheme has been developed to serve as the primary approach for achieving efficient and cost-effective fault tolerance for the framework. In most cases, the SNMR scheme yields better performance and lower cost in providing fault tolerance as compared with conventional NMR schemes.

    abstract = ""While there have been significant advances in fault tolerance research, the effort has focused on the design of individual fault-tolerant systems or methodologies. Recently, some research has been initiated to develop techniques that can provide a spectrum of fault tolerance capabilities. In this paper, we present the design of a fault tolerance framework that can support a wide range of applications with various fault tolerance requirements, various criticality levels, and various system models. The framework is designed to be parameterizable so that the user can configure it to obtain the desired features. Also, the framework is designed to be an off-the-shelf component such that application programs can be integrated within it easily to obtain the fault-tolerant version of the application system. A specialized N-modular redundancy (SNMR) scheme has been developed to serve as the primary approach for achieving efficient and cost-effective fault tolerance for the framework. In most cases, the SNMR scheme yields better performance and lower cost in providing fault tolerance as compared with conventional NMR schemes. It also enhances the scalability and customizability of the general replication method."",

344	OODP	Implementation of OSD security framework and credential cache	The concept of Object-based Storage Devices (OSD), which is standardized by the ANSI T10 technical committee, is an emerging storage paradigm that replaces storages of traditional fixed-size block abstraction with those of variable-size objects that virtualizes the under-lying physical storage. In this paper, we describe our substantial implementation of the OSD security framework in OASIS, which is an OSD system developed at ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute) in Korea. We also describe our credential caching subsystem, called Lcache, which is implemented in the client side of our OSD security framework in order to improve the performance of issuing credentials.

345	OODP	Implementation of telecontrol protocols in SCADA systems based on FSM	In China power systems began to carry out the international standard protocol-IEC60870-5-101 as the communication protocol for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated telecommunications in 1998. For the sake of the generalization of IEC60870-5-101 standard and the development of the high quality software, this paper introduces the Finite State Machine (FSM) theory for design of the communication software of the master station in SCADA systems. And this paper also presents a new framework of implementation of FSM according to the OO method. The introduction of this framework can not only make the software more reusable and flexible, but also can improve the maintenance and robustness. With the development of communication software, a more convenient and universal design pattern is introduced.

346	OODP	Implementing design patterns as parametric aspects using ParaAJ: The case of the singleton, observer, and decorator design patterns	Implementation of a design pattern can take many forms according to the programming language being used. Most of the literature presents design patterns in their conventional object-oriented implementations. Several other studies show the implementation in aspect-oriented languages such as AspectJ, EOS, and Caesar. In this work, we compare the implementation of three design patterns: singleton, observer, and decorator design patterns in these languages and also discuss the possibility of implementing them in ParaAJ: An extension to the AspectJ language that implements the idea of parametric aspects. We found that ParaAJ helps in making the implementation of the singleton and observer patterns reusable but it fails to help in the decorator case. The problem with the decorator pattern exists because of the current translation mechanism of ParaAJ's aspects to normal AspectJ's aspects. This opens the door for further work in ParaAJ to better support the idea of parametric aspects.

347	OODP	Implementing design patterns in Object Teams	This paper presents a study of the support for modularity of Object Teams, an aspect-oriented language backwards compatible with Java. The study is based on implementations in Object Teams of two complete collections of the Gang-of-Four design patterns. An analysis of the implementations is provided, in terms of advantages of Object Teams over Java with respect to modularity, module composition and reuse. We present a systematic comparison with a functionally equivalent collection of implementations in AspectJ, regarding five modularity properties: locality, reusability, composition transparency, (un)pluggability and extensibility. Object Teams yields broadly comparable results in terms of the first four properties. Object Teams yields better results as regards flexible module extensibility, composition at the instance level and enclosing multiple pattern participants into a larger, cohesive module. AspectJ is more successful than Object Teams in the Singleton pattern because of its ability to intercept constructor events.

348	OODP	Implementing reusable object-oriented components	Object-oriented (OO) classes are generally not reusable because they are not meaningful in isolation; most classes only have meaning as members of cooperating suites of classes (e.g., design patterns). These suites usually arise in designs, but rarely exist as encapsulated entities in OO implementations. In this paper we present a method for directly mapping cooperating suites of classes into encapsulated C++ implementations. Our method is an improvement over the VanHilst and Notkin approach for implementing collaboration-based designs and constitutes a step towards more reusable (object-oriented) components.

349	OODP	Implementing Ubiquitous Information services with ontologies: Methodology and case study	Currently, data integration in Ubiquitous Information Systems (UISs) is achieved by a centralized relational database where all the information coming from the remote servers is stored. To improve such architecture we proposed to convert in each server the relational archives into an RDF triple stores where data are represented by standard terms interrelated by subject-predicate-object relations (also called data ontology). In this way, UISs could be developed by a distributed approach, where data integration is achieved by an shared RDF format although data used on the remote servers follow a proprietary format. Also, the paper proposes to implement such UISs per use stories, defined according to task ontologies, to facilitate implementation from specifications. A case study illustrates how software environments based on the paradigm Model-View-Controller, e.g., Ruby on Rails powered by JQMobile, facilitate the implementation of the methodology.

351	OODP	Improvement of composite pattern based on AOP	Composite pattern is a common design pattern to solve the relationship between part and whole. But it's not easy to solve the problems in composite pattern with OOP, such as responsibility tangling, intertwining code, bad reusability. This paper presents the implementation of composite pattern with Aspect! by changing classes' behaviors with AOP technology. Compared with composite pattern with OOP, it proves that the pattern with AOP and Aspect! has better model responsibility cohesion and extensibility.

353	OODP	Improving object-oriented frameworks by considering the characteristics of constituent elements	"Advances in object-oriented frameworks (usually abbreviated as ""OOF"" or simply ""frameworks"") are currently regarded as one of the most promising areas in software development. However, many OOFs and related projects fail. To bypass known OOF related problems, a novel approach for the systematic improvement of OOFs will be introduced in this article. The proposed approach is based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the ""divide and conquer"" principle, which posits that a complex problem is easier to manage if it is broken down into simpler problems. The fundamental idea behind the research can be expressed with the assumption that elements which constitute OOF can influence the user's perceptions via the most important OOF characteristics - understandability, adaptability and confidence. The original outcome of our research is a conceptual OOF model and an OOF improvement process which can be used by framework developers as well as framework users. Several practical and theoretical implications of this work can be foreseen. Practitioners might use the outcomes of this research to develop more successful frameworks and for OOF evaluation purposes. From a theoretical viewpoint, this research can be used as a foundation for evaluating the implications of OOF-related guidelines and design approaches. While our research was mainly based on existing literature and common theories, we are aware of its limitations. Because of this, we plan to continue our research in several directions. Our current research is directed at empirically validating the conceptual OOF model that is presented in this article and at validating the proposed approach in an actual setting."

    abstract = {Advances in object-oriented frameworks (usually abbreviated as ""OOF"" or simply ""frameworks"") are currently regarded as one of the most promising areas in software development. However, many OOFs and related projects fail. To bypass known OOF related problems, a novel approach for the systematic improvement of OOFs will be introduced in this article. The proposed approach is based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the ""divide and conquer"" principle, which posits that a complex problem is easier to manage if it is broken down into simpler problems. The fundamental idea behind the research can be expressed with the assumption that elements which constitute OOF can influence the user's perceptions via the most important OOF characteristics - understandability, adaptability and confidence. The original outcome of our research is a conceptual OOF model and an OOF improvement process which can be used by framework developers as well as framework users. Several practical and theoretical implications of this work can be foreseen. Practitioners might use the outcomes of this research to develop more successful frameworks and for OOF evaluation purposes. From a theoretical viewpoint, this research can be used as a foundation for evaluating the implications of OOF-related guidelines and design approaches. While our research was mainly based on existing literature and common theories, we are aware of its limitations. Because of this, we plan to continue our research in several directions. Our current research is directed at empirically validating the conceptual OOF model that is presented in this article and at validating the proposed approach in an actual setting.},

McCall et al., 1977). Proposed changes to the model are briefly explained. A methodology for applying this model is also outlined. Its purpose is to enhance the OO software process by establishing a set of steps to be taken in the phases of an OO development project.		Alonso, F. (1); Fuertes, J.L. (1); Montes, C.

358	OODP	Incremental project plan: Introducing cleanroom method and object-oriented development method	Introducing new technologies into a software development process or project often produces both good and bad effects. If it is well planned, it will improve both productivity and quality. In this paper, we present an incremental development process planning approach (IDPA) which uses the idea of technical-dependency-based assessment of the project planning for a small and stable development team shifting slowly but steady to a new software paradigm that fits the traditional development process. The project plan was a well-connected set of incremental fragments of improvements with the introduction of new technologies or methods to the previous plans. IDPA is a method of assessing each technology or method to be decomposed and scheduled according to the technical dependency at the time of introduction. We also present a case study applying this idea to a real development project, in which object-oriented technology and the cleanroom method were introduced, and present the results of its evaluation.

359	OODP	Ineffectiveness of use of software science metrics as predictors of defects in object oriented software	Software science metrics (SSM) have been widely used as predictors of software defects. The usage of SSM is an effect of correlation of size and complexity metrics with number of defects. The SSM have been proposed keeping in view the procedural paradigm and structural nature of the programs. There has been a shift in software development paradigm from procedural to object oriented (OO) and SSM have been used as defect predictors of OO software as well. However, the effectiveness of SSM in OO software needs to be established. This paper investigates the effectiveness of use of SSM for: a) classification of defect prone modules in OO software b) prediction of number of defects. Various binary and numeric classification models have been applied on dataset kc1 with class level data to study the role of SSM. The results show that the removal of SSM from the set of independent variables does not significantly affect the classification of modules as defect prone and the prediction of number of defects. In most of the cases the accuracy and mean absolute error has improved when SSM were removed from the set of independent variables. The results thus highlight the ineffectiveness of use of SSM in defect prediction in OO software.

At the same time, state regulation of regional economic growth is considered as the general carcass of structural institutional and economic reforms (with the exception of those actions of regional authorities that contribute to regional growth) and is identified with federal regional policy. Arguing from the position of the systems approach, regional policy should be regarded as one of the directions of state regulation of economy. The characterization of the subjects of regional economy, the consolidation of efforts of which regional economic policy is aimed at, was carried out on the basis of the structural approach that followed after the stakeholder approach and reflected the peculiarities of subject-object relations taking place at any level of social and economic systems. The resort to the structural approach appears quite justified if supporting the common paradigm according to which a region is considered as a quasi-corporation. In this case, authorities (both central and regional) take interest in expanding the economic independence of the regions that allows them to realize their potential. The article also deals with some of the most urgent problems connected with the structure of the subjects of regional economy. In particular, the list of the subjects was updated to take into account the specific place of the agrarian area as a subsystem of the regional social and economic system, and a number of factors defining the efficiency of realization of regional economic policy were distinguished.

361	OODP	Information science: towards an information paradigm	For the past century, the fundamental principle guiding information management (library science, documentation, archives) rests on the idea that knowledge is universal and that, consequently, it can be organised in the same fashion everywhere. The documents upon which knowledge is stored must be described in the most objective manner possible and the places where their processing and storage are carried out must be considered as technical systems whose inputs and efficiency can be measured. Finally, the users, who wish to use this knowledge, can be classified in order to better meet their needs. Globally, this vision is consistent with a paradigm that can be qualified as classic, insofar as it has had an important impact on processing. Three principals are important; they are universality-standardisation, object-document and organisation-system. We suggest a new approach that places the human (author, mediator, user) at the centre of phenomena observed in information research. This approach is based on a paradigm that we label as informational and is completely described is a communication approach; examining this discipline becomes relevant. The founding concepts are intent, meaning and personalisation. The purpose is not to replace one paradigm with another. Each conveys a specific outlook on the world. The goal is to establish information science as a human science.		Fondin, H.

The overarching goal of IRM is to encompass and homogenise all those measurement scenarios where information available from heterogeneous sources, for example, from the object being measured, the manufacturing process that was used to fabricate it, the workings of the measurement instrument itself, as well as from any previous measurements carried with any other instrument, is gathered and somewhat incorporated with an active role into the measurement pipeline in order to ultimately achieve a higher-quality measurement result (better metrological performance, shorter measurement times, smaller consumption of resources). Examples of IRM in action in precision and additive manufacturing will be presented, including the measurement of form and texture.

364	OODP	Integrating information-system development into business process reengineering: An evaluation of software engineering paradigms	Business process reengineering (BPR) claims to improve business performance in terms of quality, cost and time by introducing a new model and a new understanding of the business. Adequate support by information technology is a key factor to achieve those benefits. Since BPR calls for a different, process-oriented way of thinking, new information systems (IS) supporting this approach are also required. The crucial question is thus how to integrate IS development into business process reengineering, or more precisely: how does information-system modelling match with organizational modelling according to BPR? In this paper, the problem of how to go from BPR business models to appropriate information-system models is examined. In particular, the object-oriented approach and the procedural approach are analyzed. Although the object-oriented paradigm promises technical benefits (such as reusability and adaptability) from features like encapsulation and inheritance, it has severe shortcomings for the steps from a business model towards information system models. The procedural paradigm was found superior in this respect.		Kurbel, K. (1); Teubner, A.	Information Systems Analysis and Synthesis.

365	OODP	Integrating LiDAR and high-resolution imagery for object-based mapping of forest habitats in a heterogeneous temperate forest landscape	Land-cover mapping (LCM) at a fine scale would be useful for forest management across heterogeneous natural landscapes. However, the heterogeneity of land covers at such scales results in complex spectral and textural properties that hinder the applicability of LCM. Besides, the method suffers from, e.g. inconsistent representation of different land-cover types, lack of sufficient and balanced training samples, and instability of classifiers trained by a high number of predictor variables. Even well-known object-based classification approaches are challenged with an objective evaluation of segmentation outputs. Here we classified partially ambiguous land-cover types across heterogeneous forest landscapes in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany) by combining metrics from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and colour infrared (CIR) imagery data and a random forest classifier implemented in an object-based paradigm. We evaluated the segmentation results by creating a global quality score based on inter- and intra-measurements of variance and the number of segments. Selected segmentation outputs were combined with balanced training samples to run the classification algorithm based on representative blocks within the national park. The entire processing chain was implemented in an open-source domain. The final segmentation consisted of LiDAR-based height, image-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and red band, with 20 cluster seeds and a minimum segment size of 40 pixels. In the classification, the most important variables included the height of the top layer, NDVI, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI). The average values of 500 random forest runs indicated an overall accuracy of 86.6% and an estimated Cohen's kappa coefficient of 85.2%, with different probabilities of correct classification for land-cover classes. Mature deciduous, standing deadwood, fallen deadwood, meadow, and bare soil classes were classified most accurately, whereas classification of young coniferous, intermediate-age coniferous, mature coniferous, young deciduous, and intermediate-age deciduous were associated with the highest uncertainties. Our methodology is sufficiently robust to be applied to other similarly structured sites across temperate forested landscapes. The versatility of the method is partially guaranteed by the proposed segmentation quality score, which satisfactorily corrects under- and over-segmentation.

368	OODP	Interactive exploration of multi-dimensional and hierarchical information spaces with real-time preference elicitation	Current proposals for preference-based information access seem to ignore that users should be acquainted with the information space and the available choices for describing effectively their preferences. Furthermore users rarely formulate complex (preference or plain) queries. The interaction paradigm of Faceted Dynamic Taxonomies (FDT) allows users to explore an information space and to restrict their focus without having to formulate queries. Instead the users can restrict their focus (object set, or set of choices in general) gradually through a simple set of actions, each corresponding to a more refined query (formulated on-the-fly) which can be enacted by a simple click. In this paper we extend this interaction paradigm with actions that allow users to dynamically express their preferences. The proposed model supports progressive preference elicitation, inherited preferences and scope-based resolution of conflicts over single or multi-valued attributes with hierarchically organized values. Finally we elaborate on the algorithmic perspective and the applicability of the model over large information bases.

370	OODP	Interface metrics for reusability analysis of components	Component-based software development relies on reusable components in order to improve quality and flexibility of products as well as increasing development productivity.

372	OODP	Inverted Linear Quadtree: Efficient Top K Spatial Keyword Search	With advances in geo-positioning technologies and geo-location services, there are a rapidly growing amount of spatio-Textual objects collected in many applications such as location based services and social networks, in which an object is described by its spatial location and a set of keywords (terms). Consequently, the study of spatial keyword search which explores both location and textual description of the objects has attracted great attention from the commercial organizations and research communities. In the paper, we study two fundamental problems in the spatial keyword queries: Top k spatial keyword search (TOPK-SK), and batch top k spatial keyword search (BTOPK-SK). Given a set of spatio-Textual objects, a query location and a set of query keywords, the TOPK-SK retrieves the closest k objects each of which contains all keywords in the query. BTOPK-SK is the batch processing of sets of TOPK-SK queries. Based on the inverted index and the linear quadtree, we propose a novel index structure, called inverted linear quadtree (IL-Quadtree), which is carefully designed to exploit both spatial and keyword based pruning techniques to effectively reduce the search space. An efficient algorithm is then developed to tackle top k spatial keyword search. To further enhance the filtering capability of the signature of linear quadtree, we propose a partition based method. In addition, to deal with BTOPK-SK, we design a new computing paradigm which partition the queries into groups based on both spatial proximity and the textual relevance between queries. We show that the IL-Quadtree technique can also efficiently support BTOPK-SK. Comprehensive experiments on real and synthetic data clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our methods.

373	OODP	Investigating the Use of Object-Oriented Design Patterns in Open-Source Software: A Case Study	During the last decade open source software communities are thriving. Nowadays, several open source projects are so popular that are considered as a standard in their domain. Additionally, the amount of source code that is freely available to developers, offer great reuse opportunities. One of the main concerns of the reuser is the quality of the code that is being reused. Design patterns are well known solutions that are expected to enhance software quality. In this paper we investigate the extent to which object-oriented design patterns are used in open-source software, across domains. B) Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

374	OODP	Is OO working as it promised?	To discuss whether or not the OO (object-oriented) paradigm for software development is working as it promised, we review what the OO software development paradigm promised. Users in different communities introduced different advantages of using OO for different applications. The OO concepts are well suited to problems using real world concepts rather than computer concepts. This means that OO can give better understanding of requirements for the target software applications we want to develop. The better understanding of requirements can give rise to a cleaner analysis of problems and a cleaner design to solve those problems. Operator polymorphism as one important feature of the OO paradigm provides easier software maintenance. The caller of an operation of a class need not be concerned about how many implementations of a given operation exist and need not be modified when a class is added. The OO paradigm also provides an environment in which designs and code are reusable on future projects, because its features such as abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance, enable libraries of reusable components to be built. Reusability can make us able to reduce the code size and the software development time. We look at what the real problems of using the OO development paradigm are in a practical sense. People in the OO community, especially OO gurus, have shown that OO technology has several benefits in software development. However, they haven't shows how difficult a sudden transition from one technique to another was, especially in business organisations.

375	OODP	Is there a need for new information security models?	A considerable number of formal information security models have been developed during the last two decades. We present and discuss some of the most widespread ones that have been successfully applied to the traditional centralised information systems of the past. We show the special security needs of modern information systems that are based on the concepts of open distributed processing, the object-oriented paradigm and multimedia technology. We argue that these information systems need new or enhanced information security models in order to address the information security issue effectively and present some efforts towards this goal.

376	OODP	Iterators and encapsulation	Iterators are an important object-oriented design pattern, providing sequential access to the state stored in other objects. Precisely because iterators need to access the state of other objects, iterators' design can be at odds with the encapsulation provided by object-oriented languages. We present a range of designs for iterator objects, showing how different designs have different encapsulation properties. Studying a range of different iterators can help programmers to identify the strengths and weaknesses of particular designs, and also illustrates some of the issues in the design of encapsulation mechanisms in programming languages.

377	OODP	It's Time to Get Good at Functional Programming	We're approaching one of those paradigm Shifts again. Knowledge of functional programming (FP) is on the verge of becoming a must-have skill. Now, we're not talking about a shift on the scale of the tectonic movement that object-oriented programming brought on. Functional programming has been around since the creation of LISP in 1958 and hasn't taken over application development, nor is it about to. FP won't make your word processing program faster or better. But there are domains where it is highly useful, and in particular FP looks like the paradigm of choice for unlocking the power of multicore processors. Functional programming languages are ideally suited to, as one developer succinctly puts it, 'solving the multicore problem.'

378	OODP	Java versus .NET: A comparative analysis of performance, size and Complexity of credit card authorization systems	This study presents a comparative analysis of the performance, size and complexity in both the Java and NET platforms. Two identical prototypes of a credit card authorization engine were developed using the JAVA and NET progmmming languages in order to measure and compare the performance of the authorization process as well as to measure and compare the size and development complexity of these two programming languages. The architecture of the singleton design pattern of a credit card authorization system using a multi-threading technique presented in this study supports the dynamic tuning of the size of the thread pool at runtime. It can be observed that the performance of the authentication engine in the .NET platform is slightly better than in the Java platform. Lines of Code (LOC) have been chosen as a metric to measure the size of the multi-threaded credit card authorization system whereby the total length of the multi-threaded credit card authorization system using a thread pool in .NET is 5048, while in Java it is 5199. The Cyclomatic Complexity number for the multi-threaded credit card authorization systems indicates that the .NET version is slightly less complicated than the Java version.

379	OODP	Key points for utilizing digital technologies at manufacturing and maintenance sites	Many companies are considering the utilization of digital technologies with the aim of improving work quality and acquiring highly accurate condition data at manufacturing and maintenance sites. However, it is not easy to reliably introduce and establish digital technologies at sites, the technologies often fail to fit operations, and such efforts often fail to progress beyond the trial and demonstration period. On-site, continuous improvement (KAIZEN) activities are implemented on a daily basis, and leading companies in industry tend to change operational procedures very often. In addition, work environments and conditions vary site by site. This leads to the need for solution agility to nimbly accommodate differences and keep up with changing on-site conditions. Accordingly, Fujitsu has adopted an approach that realizes applications that can be used continuously by converting business and digital technologies into standard business components that can be combined into design patterns for application at sites. Not only does this approach allow the quick launch of a first trial and demonstration on a small scale but it also enables the people at each site to easily modify applications to match operations after the trial phase. The introduction of new digital technologies drives operational sophistication and further growth. This paper describes key points for utilizing digital technologies at expanding manufacturing and maintenance sites with examples.

380	OODP	Knowledge amplification by structured expert randomization-KASERs in SoS design	The U.S. Army needs robotic combat vehicles that can autonomously navigate the battlefield and carry out planned missions that necessarily embody unplanned details. On one end of the spectrum lie the simple insect-like robots that have been popularized by Brooks at MIT [1]. Their simple behaviors can be evolved much in the same manner as a simple program can be created through the use of chance alone. Of course, more complex behaviors cannot be tractably evolved, because the search space here grows exponentially. What is needed are heuristics to guide the evolutionary process. We can, of course, program search strategies and have indeed programmed robots to perform a myriad of complex functions-from the robot Manny's (U.S. Army) ability to walk the battlefield to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). What is needed is a means to program more complex and reliable functionality for constant cost. That is, a system of systems (SoS) is needed. For example, one can program a robotic vehicle to sense and avoid an obstacle on the right, say. But then, what is the cost of programming the same robot to sense and avoid an obstacle on the left? It should be less, and is to some extent if object-oriented component-based programs are written. The problem here, though, is that the cost is front loaded. The programmer needs to know a priori most of the domain symmetries if he or she is to capture them in the form of objects. A better solution is to do for symbolic programming what fuzzy logic did for Boolean logic [2,3]. That is, we need the programmer to be able to constrain the robot's behavior in the form generalized actions. Then, instances of these generalizations constitute the desired program. Even search-control heuristics can be acquired through the exercise of this paradigm. Instead of programming the robot to do a specific action, we program the robot to (heuristically) search a space of actions for one or more that is consistent with environmental constraints. The writing of such programs is easier for the human, and the constraints that instantiate them serve to render the search space tractable for the machine.

381	OODP	Large-scale industrial control software research based on object-oriented design patterns	To solve some problems occurred in the development of large-scale industrial control software, a scheme based on object-oriented design patterns was proposed in this paper. This technique was applied in the design of software framework and tag module in this paper. The result shows that the coupling between modules is loosened, the complexity of code is reduced and the efficiency is improved. The time used in system development and debugging are reduced. So the potential of design pattern in software for industry control is demonstrated in this paper. And a new idea on how to design the advanced large-scale software for industry control system is proposed in this paper.

382	OODP	Liberating the programmer with prorogued programming	Programming is the process of expressing and refining ideas in a programming language. Ideally, we want our programming language to flexibly fit our natural thought process. Language innovations, such as procedural abstract, object and aspect orientation, have helped increase programming agility. However, they still lack important features that a programmer could exploit to quickly experiment with design and implementation choices. We propose prorogued programming, a new paradigm more closely aligned with a programmer's thought process. A prorogued programming language (PPL) supports three basic principles: 1) proroguing concerns1: the ability to defer a concern, to focus on and finish the current concern; 2) hybrid computation: the ability to involve the programmer as an integral part of computation; and 3) executable refinement: the ability to execute any intermediate program refinements. Working in a PPL, the programmer can run and experiment with an incomplete program, and gradually and iteratively reify the missing parts while catching design and implementation mistakes early. We describe the prorogued programming paradigm, our design and realization of the paradigm using Prorogued C#, our extension to C#, and demonstrate its utility through a few use cases.

383	OODP	Lightweight classes	The b_x001C_lightweight classesb_x001D_ design technique, which directly integrates C++ code with existing C language database libraries, helps reduce the need for expensive and complex object database systems. In addition, it eliminates the tedious and error-prone maintenance of b_x001C_object serializationb_x001D_ code that is often associated with C++ database programming. With refinement and standardization, lightweight classes could well be the grand unifying force of the C versus C++ debate-the key that permanently frees us from the unsafe world of C data types and opens the door to an equally efficient, yet far more elegant, new C++ paradigm.

SCI was developed to support closely coupled multiprocessors and their caches in a distributed shared-memory environment, but its scalability and the efficient generality of its architecture make it work very well over a wide range of applications. It can replace a local area network for connecting workstations on a campus. It can be a powerful I/O channel for a supercomputer. It can be the processor-cache-memory-I/O connection in a highly parallel computer. It can gather data from enormous particle detectors and distribute them among thousands of processors. It can connect a desktop microprocessor to memory chips a few millimeters away, disk drives a few meters away, and servers a few kilometers away.<

385	OODP	Literate programming and code reuse	The authors looks at ways in which literate programming helps you recognise the layout of a program. When given the freedom to structure program layout as you wish, you tend to group parts of the code differently than as dictated by the language or compiler. Rather than grouping all public-function declarations of a C++ class together in the public section of the class, for instance, you might group each function declaration with the corresponding function implementation. The author also examines how some of these new groups of code can be parametrised into reusable macros with the help of a simple macro processor. Specifically, the author shows how the application of design patterns such as Singleton and State can be supported by such macros.

386	OODP	Logic Programming and Co-inductive Definitions	This paper aims to define a complete semantics for a class of non-terminating logic programs. Standard approaches to deal with this problem consist in concentrating on programs where infinite derivations can be seen as computing, in the limit, some ''infinite object''.

388	OODP	Manifest3D: a framework to develop 3D graphics applications	The construction of 3D graphics applications is tedious work that consumes much more time than conventional 2D graphics applications, requiring, besides, specific knowledge about 3D geometry operations. To alleviate these problems several object-oriented frameworks for 3D graphics application construction have been proposed in the literature. They attempt to provide a generic architecture for building 3D graphics applications, but in general, they tighten their designs to specific 3D rendering libraries, or they propose ad-hoc abstractions that do not respond to generic design problems. That is, they are not designed following problem-centered design rules that can encourage a better solution in terms of flexibility and adaptability of the solution. With the goal of minimizing these problems, Manifest3D, a framework to develop 3D graphics applications, was developed. The framework design was thoroughly driven by design patterns. This process brings benefits that impact directly on understanding, reuse, evolution analysis and documentation management of the framework. As a consequence it makes the instantiation of applications easier by composition of basic behaviors. The main design aspects of Manifest3D are presented, as well as several examples of its instantiation to build 3D graphics visualizations.		Teyseyre, A. (1); Orosco, R. (1); Campo, M. (1)	ASOO'98.

389	OODP	Mapping strategies for role-oriented structures and relational databases in extracting semantically homogeneous essentials tasks	The role-oriented concept of programming is becoming more common in recent times. Expanding the traditional object-oriented paradigm, it allows us to apply a more flexible approach to the development of the information system and simplify the task of the developer. The use of role-oriented structures in modern applications raises the question of storing them in a database. The task of extracting homogeneous semantic entities from structured documents has a high potential for solving with the use of roles or their derivatives. Processing large amounts of data in such tasks requires the use of relational databases for their storage and secondary processing. The use of traditional mapping algorithms requires consideration of the issue of their effectiveness. The evaluation of the application of various algorithms is based on the search for an optimal solution to the problem of minimizing the expenditure of computer time per unit of the transformed entity. Comparative analysis of algorithms of both types makes it possible to evaluate the effect of their implementation in modern information systems.

390	OODP	Measuring the reusability of software components using static analysis metrics and reuse rate information	Nowadays, the continuously evolving open-source community and the increasing demands of end users are forming a new software development paradigm; developers rely more on reusing components from online sources to minimize the time and cost of software development. An important challenge in this context is to evaluate the degree to which a software component is suitable for reuse, i.e. its reusability. Contemporary approaches assess reusability using static analysis metrics by relying on the help of experts, who usually set metric thresholds or provide ground truth values so that estimation models are built. However, even when expert help is available, it may still be subjective or case-specific. In this work, we refrain from expert-based solutions and employ the actual reuse rate of source code components as ground truth for building a reusability estimation model. We initially build a benchmark dataset, harnessing the power of online repositories to determine the number of reuse occurrences for each component in the dataset. Subsequently, we build a model based on static analysis metrics to assess reusability from five different properties: complexity, cohesion, coupling, inheritance, documentation and size. The evaluation of our methodology indicates that our system can effectively assess reusability as perceived by developers.

391	OODP	Mementos are made of this	I look at adding undo/redo facilities to Delphi programs in the most general way I can. What is undo? What are we trying to achieve? Well, the general idea is to store the state of some thing or collection of things (be it a business object, a UML class diagram, or a record in a database) and allow the user to get back to this state after making a number of arbitrary changes. It would be even better if we could achieve this while preserving an acceptable level of encapsulation and information hiding. Once again there are a number of design patterns that can help with this, and I focus on a variation of the Memento design pattern.		Smith, M.	EXE			51-2							2					Centaur Communications, UK	
392	OODP	Mesh forging: editing of 3D-meshes using implicitly defined occluders	In recent years the ease of use and the flexibility in the editing process shifted into focus in modelling and animation applications. In this spirit we present a 3D mesh editing method that is similar to the simple constrained deformation (scodef) method9. We extend this method to the so-called mesh forging paradigm by adding an occluder to the editing environment. Our method resembles and was in fact motivated by the forging process where an anvil is used to give the manipulated object the desired shape. While users perform the editing operation by directly manipulating the 3D-mesh, the occluder is defined implicitly. To enable fine detail edits even in sparsely triangulated areas, we propose an adaptive refinement method that also allows the creation of sharp features where desired. The functionality and ease of use of our editing approach is shown by several examples.		Bendels, G. H.; Klein, R.

393	OODP	Mesh modelling with curve analogies	Modelling by analogy has become a powerful paradigm for editing images. Using a pair of before-and after-example images of a transformation, a system that models by analogy produces analogous transformations on arbitrary new images. This paper brings the expressive power of modelling by analogy to meshes. To avoid the difficulty of specifying fully 3D example meshes, we use Curve Analogies to produce changes in meshes. We apply analogies to families of curves on an object's surface, and use the filtered curves to drive a transformation of the object. We demonstrate a range of filters, from simple local feature elimination/addition, to more general frequency enhancement filters.

We demonstrate a range of filters, from simple local feature elimination/addition, to more general frequency enhancement filters. (c) 2004 IEEE."",

394	OODP	Message communication facilities for distributed real-time systems based on concurrent object-oriented paradigm	With the development of high-speed communication services in public communication networks, there is a demand for the application of distributed processing based on the concurrent object-oriented paradigm to the communication service control software. This paper discusses message communication facilities with a high processing ability per unit time, a short processing time, and a high reliability that can be applied to communication service control. In the proposed facilities, a buffer with the fixed length used to store the message content is allocated to the shared space in each communication control node, which can be accessed from all user space. By passing the pointer to the buffer, communication processing is made efficient and management overhead is reduced. Reliability is improved by memory that checks unauthorized access to the message buffer in the shared space. In order to realize the efficient communication of large-scale messages, outline message communication is supported, using the page map switching and copy-on-write control. In internode communication, the internode communication control object multiplexes and processes the messages by the connection set between the nodes. Between the internode communication control object and the transmission/reception object, the number of copies is reduced by passing the pointer 10 the ffer.

395	OODP	Meta data conundrum carries on	OMG has turned to XML in its latest effort to create a standard meta data architecture; can this effort gain support from suppliers where others have failed? The new approach consists of a model-driven architecture that will transcend individual technologies, so it will be valid even when underlying technologies change. To create the new architecture, its builders have expanded the meaning of meta data. They are also leveraging the object oriented paradigm so that corporations can create reusable meta data objects from data about their existing resources, including computer languages, file systems and software architecture, by wrapping the data with Extensible Markup Language (XML) descriptions. The new architecture will be the sole enterprise meta data management standard available because the OMG merged last year (2000) with another standards body, the Meta Data Coalition, whose efforts were built around Microsoft's Open Information Model (OIM), and OMG is merging OIM based work with its own.

396	OODP	Meta objects for access control: Extending capability-based security	Object-based programming is becoming more and more popular and is currently conquering the world of distributed programming models. In object-based systems, access control is often based on capabilities, as capability-based security is a well-known paradigm. It has been extended by means to restrict, revoke, and expire capabilities. On the other hand, capabilities have serious drawbacks. First, in object-based systems, programming is based on the frequent exchange of object references (i.e., capabilities). Thus, it is hard to check which parts of an application are able to gain control of a certain capability. This becomes even harder if we consider distributed object-based systems like Java RMI and CORBA. Second, a capability usually cannot prevent method invocations from leaking unprotected references as return values. Transitive access control is not possible in a transparent way, which is independent of the code describing the invocation. We present a new security paradigm based on meta objects. Meta objects can be attached to object references and control access to the corresponding objects. Meta objects offer the same functionality as capability-based security. In addition, they can be used for implicit and transitive access control of object references passed as a parameter or as a result. Such a reference can be automatically protected by the meta object by attaching itself or another meta object to the reference before passing it on. Meta objects can implement arbitrary and user-defined security policies. They help to separate security policies from application code, and thus support reuse.

397	OODP	Meteor showers from the debris of broken comets:: D/1819 W<sub>1</sub> (Blanpain), 2003 WY<sub>25</sub>, and the Phoenicids	The discovery of extinct comet nucleus 2003 EH1 in the orbit of the massive Quadrantid meteor shower, and its tentative identification as a fragment of comet C/1490 Y-1, is now followed by the discovery that minor planet 2003 WY25 is among the meteoroids causing the Phoenicid shower and may be a remnant of comet D/1819W(1) ( Blanpain). Backward integration of 2003 WY25 to 1819 shows agreement in angular elements to 0.degrees 2 accuracy, proving the association, with no better agreement expected because of the poorly determined orbit of D/Blanpain. 2003 WY25 is a faint object, suggesting it is only a similar to 400m diameter fragment of D/Blanpain, broken up shortly before or during the 1819 return. Forward integration of the perturbations on the dust trail that would be generated in such a breakup shows that this dust accounts for the 1956 outburst of Phoenicids and establishes the link between the meteoroids and the comet. This new result adds further evidence to a new paradigm: that most of our short-period meteor showers are due to the breakup of comets. These showers ( and the remaining fragments) include at least the Geminids ( 3200 Phaethon), the Quadrantids (2003 EH1), the Daytime Arietids (Marsden group of sunskirters), the Andromedids (fragments of 3D/Biela), and now also the Phoenicids (2003 WY25). The amount of mass in each stream is relatively small, that of a single fragment. If comet 9P/Tempel 1 breaks during NASA's Deep Impact mission, a meteoroid stream will be created in much the same manner as what causes most of our meteor showers.	comets : individual (2003 WY25;  D/1819 W-1 (Blanpain);  2003 EH1); meteors;  meteoroids; minor planets;  asteroids; comets : individual (2003 WY25, D/1819 W-1 (Blanpain), 2003 EH1);  meteors, meteoroids;  minor planets, asteroids	Jenniskens, P; Lyytinen, E	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1086/432469		1286-1290	"""@article{WOS:000231450900031,

398	OODP	Methods to design provided, required and customize interfaces of software components	Component-based development is gaining a wide acceptance as an economical software development paradigm to develop applications by utilizing reusable software components. Well-defined interface manages coupling and cohesion between components, minimizes the effect on the user in case of component evolvement, and enhances reusability, extendibility and maintainability. Therefore, study on systematic development process and design guidelines for component interface has been required since the component has been introduced. In this paper, we propose three types of interfaces based on software architecture layers and functionality types: provided interface which provides functionality of a component; required interface which specifies required functionality that is provided by other components; and customize interface which tailors the component to customer's requirement. In addition, we suggest design criteria for well-designed interface, and systematic process and instructions for designing interface. We firstly cluster operations extracted from use case model and class model to identify provided interfaces and design customize interfaces based on artifacts for variability. We also specify required interfaces by identifying dependency among interfaces. Proposed interface design method provides traceability, throughout the component interface design. And furthermore, proposed guidelines support practical design for high quality component based on a case study.

399	OODP	Metrics analysis in object oriented and aspect oriented programming	Background: Object oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that has been used for several years by the software engineering community. The best practice of OOP was gathered and they are known as Design Patterns. They provide guidelines for developing flexible software applications. Recent studies claim that some patterns have limitations and their implementations could be improved. Researchers claim that Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a paradigm that provides features to overcome the limitations of OOP and patterns. However, even with the good results achieved using AOP, it is possible to cause side effects in code. We revised all patents relating to aspect oriented programming of applicability. This paper tries to implement a subset of the patterns with AOP and identify merits and demerits in comparison with the traditional OOP implementations. In another term if a method which is called several time in different class so we use to write code on both classes (if we don't want to overload it) and manually write code of function call after those methods which we want to execute. Methods: Aspect-Oriented Programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts called so-called concerns. The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting concerns are conceptually separate from the application's business logic. There are various common good examples of aspects like logging, auditing, declarative transactions, security, and caching, etc. Results: after the implement AOP concept with OOPs, the response time is reduce and throughput rate is increases. And the development of program is become more easy and reliable. Conclusion: so those method which is called several time in a program execution these type of method must be written in AOP so it is triggered automatically when the pointcode if occurred.

    abstract = ""Background: Object oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that has been used for several years by the software engineering community. The best practice of OOP was gathered and they are known as Design Patterns. They provide guidelines for developing flexible software applications. Recent studies claim that some patterns have limitations and their implementations could be improved. Researchers claim that Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a paradigm that provides features to overcome the limitations of OOP and patterns. However, even with the good results achieved using AOP, it is possible to cause side effects in code. We revised all patents relating to aspect oriented programming of applicability. This paper tries to implement a subset of the patterns with AOP and identify merits and demerits in comparison with the traditional OOP implementations. In another term if a method which is called several time in different class so we use to write code on both classes (if we don't want to overload it) and manually write code of function call after those methods which we want to execute. Methods: Aspect-Oriented Programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts called so-called concerns. The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting concerns are conceptually separate from the application's business logic. There are various common good examples of aspects like logging, auditing, declarative transactions, security, and caching, etc. Results: after the implement AOP concept with OOPs, the response time is reduce and throughput rate is increases. And the development of program is become more easy and reliable. Conclusion: so those method which is called several time in a program execution these type of method must be written in AOP so it is triggered automatically when the pointcode if occurred.

400	OODP	Metrics for Applying GOF Design Patterns in Refactoring Processes	This paper presents a kind of software design measures that help us to determine the application of Gang-Of-Four design patterns to refactoring processes. Refactoring using design patterns is one of the promising approaches to improve the designs during development activities, and a crucial issue is to identify when, where and which patterns could be applied. We analyzed several actual object-oriented designs of low quality needed to be refactored and focus on the characteristics of conditional statements of methods and inheritance structures, which seemed to cause the low quality. We provide 20 measures to objectively detect these characteristics in object-oriented designs. These measures express the complexity of branching execution in conditional statements and the strength of the dependency among the sub classes in the inheritance trees. Designers can be guided to recognize when, where and which design patterns should be used, in order to refactor their designs of low quality, by calculating these measures. We apply our approach to the low-quality design of the drawing editor that was produced by a novice designer and assess the effectiveness of our measures.

401	OODP	MidNet: An Anchor-and-Angle-Free Detector for Oriented Ship Detection in Aerial Images	Ship detection in aerial images remains an active yet challenging task due to its arbitrary object orientation and various aspect ratios from the bird's-eye perspective. Most existing oriented objection detection methods rely on angular prediction or predefined anchor boxes, making these methods highly sensitive to unstable angular regression and excessive hyperparameter setting. To address these issues, we replace the angular-based object encoding with an anchor-and-angle-free paradigm and propose a novel detector deploying a center and four midpoints for encoding each oriented object, namely, MidNet. Moreover, MidNet designs a novel symmetrical deformable convolution for enhancing the features of midpoints; then, the center and midpoints for an identical ship are adaptively matched by predicting corresponding centripetal shift and matching radius. Finally, a concise analytical geometry algorithm is proposed to calculate the ship orientation and refine the keypoints stepwisely for building precise oriented bounding boxes. On two public ship detection datasets, HRSC2016 and FGSD2021, MidNet outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors by achieving APs of 90.52% and 86.50%.

402	OODP	Migrating large object-oriented applications into component-based ones instantiation and inheritance transformation	Large object-oriented applications have complex and numerous dependencies, and usually do not have explicit software architectures. Therefore they are hard to maintain, and parts of them are difficult to reuse. Component-based development paradigm emerged for improving these aspects and for supporting effective maintainability and reuse. It provides better understandability through a high-level architecture view of the application. Thereby migrating objectoriented applications to component-based ones will contribute to improve these characteristics (maintainability and reuse). In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically transform objectoriented applications to component-based ones. More particularly, the input of the approach is the result provided by software architecture recovery: a component-based architecture description. Then, our approach transforms the object-oriented source code in order to produce deployable components. We focus in this paper on the transformation of source code related to instantiation and inheritance dependencies between classes that are in different components. We experimented the proposed solution in the transformation of a collection of Java applications into the OSGi framework. The experimental results are discussed in this paper.

403	OODP	MixDecorator: An enhanced version of decorator pattern	Decorator design pattern is a very well-known pattern that allows additional functionality to be dynamically attached to an object. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. In this paper we analyze and design a pattern - MixDecorator - That could be considered an enhanced version of the Decorator pattern, which does not just eliminate some constraints or limitations of the original one, but also allows it to be used as a base of a general extension mechanism.

404	OODP	Model driven security for Web services (MDS4WS)	Model driven architecture is an approach to increase the quality of complex software systems based on creating high level system models that represent systems at different abstract levels and automatically generating system architectures from the models. We show how this paradigm can be applied to what we call model driven security for Web services. In our approach, a designer builds an interface model for the Web services along with security requirements using the object constraint language (OCL) and role based access control (RBAC) and then generates from these specifications a complete configured security infrastructure in the form of Extended Access Control Markup Language (XACML) policy files. Our approach can be used to improve productivity during the development of secure Web services and quality of resulting systems.

405	OODP	Model for the migration to object-oriented software development with special emphasis on improvement of acceptance	Object-oriented technology has been established as an important new paradigm in software development. Thus, many organizations involved in any kind of software production plan to migrate to object-oriented technology or have already started this process. Besides several successful migrations, many failures occur. In order to reduce the risk of failure during the migration process, we developed a migration model based on an empirical study. The application of this model leads to a better understanding of the migration process and supports its planning, designing and implementation-putting special emphasis on improvement of acceptance. The theoretical foundations of our migration model come from technology management, organizational research (i.e. change management, and organizational roles), as well as existing approaches and models for this kind of migration. Our migration model consists of three main parts: the migration process model, the definition of organizational roles, and the use of acceptance strategies such as information and communication, participation, and further education. The main results concerning the use of acceptance strategies-based on the results of the empirical study-are presented.

406	OODP	Model-driven security engineering for trust management in SECTET	Service Oriented Architectures with underlying technologies like web services and web services orchestration have opened the door to a wide range of novel application scenarios, especially in the context of inter-organizational cooperation. One of the remaining obstacles for a widespread use of these techniques is security. Companies and organizations open their systems and core business processes to partners only if a high level of trust can be guaranteed. The emergence of web services security standards provides a valuable and effective paradigm for addressing the security issues arising in the context of inter-organizational cooperation. The low level of abstraction of these standards is, however, still an unresolved issue which makes them inaccessible to the domain expert and remains a major obstacle when aligning security objectives with the customer needs. Their complexity makes implementation easily prone of error. The SECTET - a model-driven security engineering framework for B2B-workflows - facilitates the design and implementation of secure inter-organizational workflows. This contribution has three objectives. First we present a high-level domain specific language - called SECTET-PL. Being part of the SECTET-framework, SECTET-PL is a policy language influenced by Object Constraint Language and interpreted in the context of UML models.We then detail the Meta Object Facility based metamodels for the integration of business requirements with the security requirements. Finally, using Model Driven Architecture paradigm, we describe the transformation of high-level security models to low-level web services standard artefacts with the help of Eclipse Modelling Framework and OpenArchitectureWare.

407	OODP	Modelling transport objects with patterns. The foundation of software systems	Design patterns have provided us with a formalism for capturing frequently occurring components within our public transport object models; they gave us a language for describing these components to others; they provided us with the building bricks and framework for assembling new solutions to problems with which we had previously struggled. Here is a report of our experience in using some existing design patterns-Role (State) and Strategy-to model some transport objects that play multiple concurrent roles and contain multiple solutions. These patterns occur over and over again within our models. We discuss how these patterns have helped to achieve better designed transport objects.		Foster, T. (1); Zhao, L.

409	OODP	Modes for software architectures	Modern systems are heterogeneous, geographically distributed and highly dynamic since the communication topology can vary and the components can, at any moment, connect to or detach from the system. Service oriented computing (SOC) has emerged as a suitable paradigm for specifying and implementing such global systems. The variety and dynamics in the possible scenarios implies that considering such systems as belonging to a single architectural style is not helpful. These considerations take us to propose the notion of mode as a new element of architectural descriptions. A mode abstracts a specific set of services that must interact for the completion of a specific subsystem task. This paper presents initial ideas regarding the formalization of modes and mode transitions as explicit elements of architectural descriptions with the goal of providing flexible support for the description and verification of complex adaptable service oriented systems. We incorporate the notion of mode to the Darwin architectural language and apply it to illustrate how modes may help on describing systems from the automotive domain.		Hirsch, D. (1); Kramer, J.

410	OODP	Modifiers: Increasing richness and nuance of design pattern languages	One of the challenges when establishing and maintaining a pattern language is to balance richness with simplicity. On the one hand, designers need a variety of useful design patterns to increase the speed of their design efforts and to reduce design risk. On the other hand, the greater the variety of design patterns in a language, the higher the cognitive load to remember and select among them. One solution to this problem is the concept of a modifier design pattern, a design pattern for pattern languages. A modifier pattern is a named, documented variation that can be applied to some set of other design patterns. They create similar, useful changes and refinements to the solutions derived from any pattern to which they are applied. The modifier concept, described in this paper emerged in a relatively new design pattern language for collaborative work practices in which the design patterns are called thinkLets. When analyzing the thinkLet pattern language, we found that many of the patterns we knew were variations and refinements of other patterns. However, we also found patterns in these variations; we found variations that could be applied to different patterns, with similar effects. We document these variations as modifiers. In this paper, we introduce the concept of modifier design patterns and illustrate the use of modifiers with two case studies.

411	OODP	Modularizing design patterns with aspects: A quantitative study	Design patterns offer flexible solutions to common problems in software development. Recent studies have shown that several design patterns involve crosscutting concerns. Unfortunately, object-oriented (OO) abstractions are often not able to modularize those crosscutting concerns, which in turn compromise the system reusability and maintainability. Hence, it is important verifying whether aspect-oriented approaches support improved modularization of crosscutting concerns relative to design patterns. Ideally, quantitative studies should be performed to compare OO and aspect-oriented implementations of classical patterns with respect to fundamental software engineering attributes, such as coupling and cohesion. This paper presents a quantitative study that compares Java and AspectJ solutions for the 23 Gang-of-Four patterns. We have used stringent software attributes as the assessment criteria. We have found that most aspect-oriented solutions improve separation of pattern-related concerns, although only four aspect-oriented implementations have exhibited significant reuse. This paper also discusses the scalability of the analyzed solutions with respect to separation of concerns, and the determination of a predictive model for the modularization of design patterns with aspects.

413	OODP	Momentum Exchange Between Light and Nanostructured Matter	An objectb_x0019_s translational and rotational motion is associated with linear and angular momenta. When multiple objects interact the exchange of momentum dictates the new systemb_x0019_s motion. Since light, despite being massless, carries both linear and angular momentum it too can partake in this momentum exchange and mechanically affect matter in tangible ways. Due to conservation of momentum, any such exchange must be reciprocal, and the light therefore acquires an opposing momentum component. Hence, light and matter are inextricably connected and one can be manipulated to induce interesting effects to the other. Naturally, any such effect is facilitated by having strongly enhanced light-matter interaction, which for visible light is something that is obtained when nanostructured matter supports optical resonances. This thesis explores this reciprocal relationship and how nanostructured matter can be utilised to augment these phenomena.Once focused by a strong lens, light can form optical tweezers which through optical forces and torques can confine and manipulate small particles in space. Metallic nanorods trapped in two dimensions against a cover glass can receive enough angular momentum from circularly polarised light to rotate with frequencies of several tens of kilohertz. In the first paper of this thesis, the photothermal effects associated with such optical rotations are studied to observe elevated thermal environments and morphological changes to the nanorod. Moreover, to elucidate upon the interactions between the trapped particle and the nearby glass surface, in the thesisb_x0019_ second paper a study is conducted to quantify the separation distance between the two under different trapping conditions. The particle is found to be confined 30-90 nm away from the surface.The momentum exchange from a single nanoparticle to a light beam is negligible. However, by tailoring the response of an array of nanoparticles, phase-gradient metasurfaces can be constructed that collectively and controllably alter the incoming lightb_x0019_s momentum in a macroscopically significant way, potentially enabling a paradigm shift to flat optical components. In the thesisb_x0019_ third paper, a novel fabrication technique to build such metasurfaces in a patternable polymer resist is investigated. The technique is shown to produce efficient, large-scale, potentially flexible, substrate-independent flat optical devices with reduced fabricational complexity, required time, and cost.At present, optical metasurfaces are commonly viewed as stationary objects that manipulate light just like common optical components, but do not themselves react to the lightb_x0019_s changed momentum. In the last paper of this thesis, it is realised that this is an overlooked potential source of optical force and torque. By incorporating a beam-steering metasurface into a microparticle, a new type of nanoscopic robot b_x0013_ a metavehicle b_x0013_ is invented. Its propulsion and steering are based on metasurfaceinduced optical momentum transfer and the metavehicle is shown to be driven in complex shapes even while transporting microscopic cargo.

Three experiments examined whether another spatial feature, object orientation, could be monitored and represented in a similar fashion.

Experiment 2 showed that orientation monitoring is strongly affected by layout complexity, viewpoint changes, and the extent of array modifications. Finally, Experiment 3 suggested that an object's behavioral relevance may selectively enhance its orientation processing.

415	OODP	Motion Hint Field with Content Adaptive Motion Model for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)	Traditional video coding standards employ block-based translational motion modelwhere all the pixels inside the current block are assigned a single motion vector. Thisuniformity of motion within a block assumption does not hold if the block containsa motion discontinuity. To improve the coding gain, modern video codecs partitionblocks around object boundaries into smaller square or rectangular sub-blocks. The prediction residual energy of the current frame is minimized at the expense of increasing the bit rate to code motion data. The inspiration behind motion hints is to move away from this redundant approach of using the motion model to describe object boundaries, since the spatial structure of previously-decoded frames can be exploited to infer appropriate boundaries for the future ones.A motion hint provides a global description of motion over a specific domain and is related to the foreground-background segmentation where the foreground and background motions are the hints. A bi-directional motion hints based coding paradigm was proposed in [1, 2] that carries out segmentation in the reference frames. The segmented foreground and background regions are then mapped (motion compensated) and fused together to generate a prediction for the current frame. In this paper, the motion hint model is tuned according to the motion hint field's complexity for superior motion compensation, where the candidate motion model set is affine, elastic[3].

416	OODP	Movement of visual attention	One of widespread metaphors for visual attention is that it acts as if shining a spotlight on the visual field. This spotlight metaphor indicates that attention selects a place at which to enhance the efficiency of information processing and this is supported by a number of experiments. The spotlight metaphor, furthermore, suggests that the attentional beam can move smoothly as would a spotlight. Contrary to spatial selection, this part of the metaphor is controversial. Although there are several reports in the literature that suggest the smooth motion of visual attention, several researchers have pointed out serious methodological problems of these reports. The results of these reports may be explained with shifts of attention that discretely jumps. Since saccadic eye movements (jumpy eye movements to shift the line of sight) are thought to follow the attentional spotlight, attention may be a mechanism to shift discretely. On the other hand, attention may shift smoothly when observers are tracking smoothly moving objects. Previous reports measured the effect of reaction time speeding by pre-cues, which is assumed to attract attention at a location. Shifting attention to the pre-cued location may not elicit smooth shifts in attention. We introduce a paradigm to measure the location of attention while tracking a moving object to examine whether attention moves smoothly in such cases, and show evidence that support the smooth motion of attention.

417	OODP	Multidimensional radar waveforms	This paper introduces and analyses the innovative paradigm of multidimensional waveform encoding for space- borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The combination of this technique with digital beamforming on receive enables a new class of highly performant SAR systems employing novel and highly flexible radar imaging modes. Examples are adaptive high-resolution wide-swath SAR imaging with compact antennas, enhanced parameter estimation sensitivity for applications like along-track interferometry and moving object indication, and the implementation of hybrid SAR imaging modes that are well suited to satisfy the hitherto incompatible user requirements for frequent monitoring and detailed mapping. Implementation specific issues will be discussed and examples demonstrate the potential of the new technique for different remote sensing applications.		Krieger, G. (1); Gebert, N. (1); Moreira, A.

418	OODP	Multi-object video error recovery over wireless networks	In this paper, we investigate the use of a FEC-based error control mechanism for loss protection in wireless MO video systems. The Multi-Object video coding schemes enhances the traditional concept of video sequence and proposes a synchronized set of video objects (VO) organized in a flexible way. According to this new paradigm, wireless MO video delivery becomes one of the greatest challenges in the near future. Unfortunately, wireless networks are characterized by large number of packet losses because of fading communication channels. Thus, loss recovery mechanisms must be added to prevent video degradation. In this paper, we propose a video object-based unequal error protection mechanism, which allocate an optimal FEC redundancy ratio to each object. This FEC allocation is done according to video objects relevance, and the wireless network packet loss rate. This wireless packet loss rate is modeled using a Gilbert-Elliot model. Our results demonstrate that video quality degradation can be significantly reduced.

419	OODP	Multi-Object Video Rate Control	The ISO MPEG-4 standard enhances the traditional concept of video sequence and proposes a synchronized set of visual objects organized in a flexible way. The video delivery according to this new paradigm results in a challenging new bit-allocation, and rate-control mechanisms, which has to satisfy complex application requirements. In this paper, we propose a rate control mechanism, which optimally selects the sending rate for each object constituting the video scene. This rate allocation is done in agreement with the particularity of the multi-object video coding schemes. Thus, in our proposal, we allocate more bandwidth to the object having the most impact on the video quality. To perform this optimal allocation, we use the dynamic programming approach to select the optimal amount of bandwidth to be allocated to each object. The obtained results show the importance of this consideration in multi-object video delivery. We demonstrate that the video quality can be significantly increased.

420	OODP	Multithreaded programming with the Command pattern	There is no question that multithreaded programming adds a layer of complexity to applications. With concurrent processing, debugging becomes more difficult, critical sections of code must be protected, and shared resources have to be managed. Of course, the trade-off is that by adding multiple strands of execution to an application, efficiency can be dramatically increased. From a programmer's perspective, the gains awarded by introducing concurrent execution often hardly seem worthwhile when compared to the headaches involved in dealing with threads-mysterious things happen that hide when inspected under the debugger, or irreproducible bugs pop up at haphazard intervals, or worst of all, things do not run any faster. Many of these annoyances can be avoided by localizing thread logic and carefully managing shared resources-which is often much more difficult than it appears. By coupling the Command design pattern with a multithreaded application, one can perfect the nuances of multithreaded programming by creating a framework that encapsulates most of the multithreaded behavior and reduces development to application-level logic. Moreover, this mechanism allows you to develop in an open/closed manner, which means that none of the working thread code needs to be modified as you add more and more functionality. This design pattern can help you avoid some common multithreading pitfalls.		Pee, J.	Windows Developer Magazine			2024-05-20 00:00:00							2					CMP Media LLC, USA	
421	OODP	Multitouch gestures for constrained transformation of 3D objects	3D transformation widgets allow constrained manipulations of 3D objects and are commonly used in many 3D applications for fine-grained manipulations. Since traditional transformation widgets have been mainly designed for mouse-based systems, they are not user friendly for multitouch screens. There is little research on how to use the extra input bandwidth of multitouch screens to ease constrained transformation of 3D objects. This paper presents a small set of multitouch gestures which offers a seamless control of manipulation constraints (i.e., axis or plane) and modes (i.e., translation, rotation or scaling). Our technique does not require any complex manipulation widgets but candidate axes, which are for visualization rather than direct manipulation. Such design not only minimizes visual clutter but also tolerates imprecise touch-based inputs. To further expand our axis-based interaction vocabulary, we introduce intuitive touch gestures for relative manipulations, including snapping and borrowing axes of another object. A preliminary evaluation shows that our technique is more effective than a direct adaption of standard transformation widgets to the tactile paradigm.	3D application; 3D transformations; Direct manipulation; Fine grained; Multi-touch gestures; Seamless controls; User friendly; Visual clutter; Computer graphics; 3D application;  3D transformations;  Direct manipulation;  Fine grained;  Multi-touch gestures;  Seamless controls;  User friendly;  Visual clutter;  Computer graphics	Au, Oscar Kin-Chung; Tai, Chiew-Lan; Fu, Hongbo	Computer Graphics Forum	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03044.x		651 - 660	"""@ARTICLE{Au2012651,

423	OODP	Necklace: An Architecture for Distributed and Robust Service Function Chains with Guarantees	The service function chaining paradigm links ordered service functions via network virtualization, in support of applications with severe network constraints. To provide wide-area (federated) virtual network services, a distributed architecture should orchestrate cooperating or competing processes to generate and maintain virtual paths hosting service function chains while, guaranteeing performance and fast asynchronous consensus even in the presence of failures. To this end, we propose a prototype of an architecture for robust service function chain instantiation with convergence and performance guarantees. To instantiate a service chain, our system uses a fully distributed asynchronous consensus mechanism that has bounds on convergence time and leads to a (1 - 1/e)-approximation ratio with respect to the Pareto optimal chain instantiation, even in the presence of (non-byzantine) failures. Moreover, we show that a better optimal chain approximation cannot exist. To establish the practicality of our approach, we evaluate the system performance, policy tradeoffs, and overhead via simulations and through a prototype implementation. We then describe our extensible management object model and compare our asynchronous consensus's overhead against Raft, a recent decentralized consensus protocol, showing superior performance. We furthermore discuss a new management object model for distributed service function chain instantiation.

426	OODP	Non-Homogeneous Multi-Unit Collaborative Communications: A Theory and Application for Virtual Real-Time Service	A novel communication service methodology, virtual real-time service, was proposed to discover and utilize the rich temporal and spectrum resource hidden in the negative time axis. Thanks to the delay tolerance of embedded wireless pushing, it could help to unify the content demand of different users, so as to achieve significant spectral and energy efficiency gains of wireless multicasting. The three extensions of cognition object, time scale, and coordination range, induced by virtual real-time service were described. The consumption of computation and storage resource was a cost to be paid for the gains of the energy and spectral efficiency. Hence, the multi-unit collaboration of computation (including cognition), storage, and communications units was highly desired to minimize the cost of computation and storage resource, while maximize the energy and spectral efficiency gains. The proposed scheme holds the promise of overcoming the stringent restrain on the spectral efficiency, which is caused by the current communication architecture and its underlying theory. The union of its two main characteristics, namely, time non-homogenous transmission and multi-unit collaboration, are expected to form a paradigm-shift theory on time non-homogenous multi-unit collaboration communications.

428	OODP	Notification-Oriented Paradigm Framework 2.0: An Implementation Based On Design Patterns	The Notification-Oriented Paradigm (NOP) is a new technique to develop software. NOP is a rule-oriented approach where every rule and fact-base element is derived into less complex entities with specific tasks. These entities particularly collaborate by means of notifications, which occur only when their state changes. This allows carrying out an inference process completely active. Due to this particular arrangement, NOP can eliminate most of the structural and temporal redundancies that affects program execution performance, difficulties in codification level, and high coupling in program modules. In order to validate the NOP state of art, a framework was initially implemented in C++. Even though it quite demonstrated the features of the paradigm in terms of the development process, it still presented a gap in execution performance. In this context, this paper presents the NOP Framework 2.0. This new version was reengineered aiming better structuration and improvements in the execution time of NOP applications. The experiments show that the new implementation is two times faster than the former one. In addition, new experiments were presented comparing the NOP applications to equivalent implementations based on Oriented-Object Paradigm (OOP) in C++. The NOP applications presented, in some cases, better performance than the OOP applications.

429	OODP	NS 1987A in SN 1987A	The possible detection of a compact object in the remnant of SN 1987A presents an unprecedented opportunity to follow its early evolution. The suspected detection stems from an excess of infrared emission from a dust blob near the compact object's predicted position. The infrared excess could be due to the decay of isotopes like 44Ti, accretion luminosity from a neutron star or black hole, magnetospheric emission or a wind originating from the spin down of a pulsar, or to thermal emission from an embedded, cooling neutron star (NS 1987A). It is shown that the last possibility is the most plausible as the other explanations are disfavored by other observations and/or require fine-tuning of parameters. Not only are there indications that the dust blob overlaps the predicted location of a kicked compact remnant, but its excess luminosity also matches the expected thermal power of a 30 yr old neutron star. Furthermore, models of cooling neutron stars within the minimal cooling paradigm readily fit both NS 1987A and Cas A, the next-youngest known neutron star. If correct, a long heat transport timescale in the crust and a large effective stellar temperature are favored, implying relatively limited crustal n-1S0 superfluidity and an envelope with a thick layer of light elements, respectively. If the locations do not overlap, then pulsar spin down or accretion might be more likely, but the pulsar's period and magnetic field or the accretion rate must be rather finely tuned. In this case, NS 1987A may have enhanced cooling and/or a heavy-element envelope.

430	OODP	Nucleus C++-an overview	Accelerated Technology recently introduced Nucleus C++ to allow programmers to truly use the object-oriented programming paradigm to develop real-time solutions. This paper describes the technology employed and some of the capabilities that it affords. By facilitating an object-oriented approach to real-time system development, Nucleus C++ allows its users to truly focus efforts on application details as opposed to implementation details. The more Nucleus C++ is used, the more powerful it becomes, because the general functionality that Nucleus C++ has built into the C++ language for real-time systems can be extended further by the user. The user's base of application-specific classes will then expand, increasing future profitability by decreasing risk and time-to-market. The costs associated with developing real-time operating systems are great. By using Nucleus C++, the user's investment in time and development dollars is focused on value-added applications.

431	OODP	Object methods: what are they and are they important?	The necessity for object methods, the definition of the method required, and the current consensus regarding object-oriented methods, are discussed. A number of points on which there is not a general consensus are summarised, namely the relationship between the analysis of data and the object approach, meeting the needs of both analyst and designer, reuse, use of design patterns, reuse between projects, and other areas for improvement. The place of standardisation within the process is considered.		Whitebread, K.	Genie Logiciel			26-30							2					EC2 & Developpement, France	
432	OODP	Object orientation in CS1-CS2 by design	"This paper argues for a design driven approach to an object-oriented CS1-CS2 sequence in which object-orientation is thematic. Our approach integrates several components: (i) a strong object-oriented approach, (ii) design using UML, (iii) design patterns to manage complexity, and (iv) complex examples and projects to motivate the use of object-orientation and to motivate students by solving non-trivial problems. While this is a ""programming-first"" approach to CS1-CS2, it addresses several disadvantages of programming-first approaches noted in CC2001 [7]. The approach focuses on design rather than syntax, so students do not lose sight of the forest for the trees.

    abstract = {This paper argues for a design driven approach to an object-oriented CS1-CS2 sequence in which object-orientation is thematic. Our approach integrates several components: (i) a strong object-oriented approach, (ii) design using UML, (iii) design patterns to manage complexity, and (iv) complex examples and projects to motivate the use of object-orientation and to motivate students by solving non-trivial problems. While this is a ""programming-first"" approach to CS1-CS2, it addresses several disadvantages of programming-first approaches noted in CC2001 [7]. The approach focuses on design rather than syntax, so students do not lose sight of the forest for the trees. We use (relatively speaking) large and complex examples, especially in the CS2 course, which allows us to address in a meaningful way issues of programming in the large.

433	OODP	Object oriented design knowledge: ontology and measurement of impact	It has been a long time since the appearance of the object oriented (OO) paradigm. From that moment, the designers have accumulated much knowledge in the design and construction of OO systems. Patterns are the most refined OO design knowledge. However, there are many other kinds of knowledge that are not yet classified and formalized. We distinguish and classify the following categories: principles, heuristics, patterns and refactorings. We propose an ontology for object oriented design knowledge and a measure of impact for patterns, two key elements to create a method based on knowledge.		Garzas, J. (1); Piattini, M.

434	OODP	Object-oriented finite element programming: An interactive environment for symbolic derivations, application to an initial boundary value problem	Object-oriented finite element programming has been receiving increasing attention recently. In recent papers the authors' research group has systematically developed a methodology of implementing finite elements within the context of an object-oriented paradigm, using several languages successively: Smalltalk, Ctalk and finally C++. The key features of the object-oriented approach (data encapsulation, message passing, hierarchical code organization, inheritance and polymorphism) have been shown to produce codes with enhanced modularity and improved reusability, even among different programmers, and to lead to faster prototyping and easier debugging of new codes. In this article an attempt to go beyond this stage is illustrated. The principles of object-oriented programming are applied directly to the problem statement in differential form. The new approach is conducted as follows: User input: strong form Symbolic derivation: weak form Symbolic derivation: Galerkin form Symbolic derivation: matrix form Numerical derivation: numerical matrix form All derivations are carried out in symbolic form except for that of the final numerical matrix form. The barriers between symbolic and numerical programming are broken and the code is generated automatically. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated by its application to linear elastodynamics.

The first section of this paper covers the goals and some fundamental concepts, and asks whether OOP is merely a refinement of previous experience or whether it is a radical paradigm shift. The following sections illustrate the use of OOP through the use of some case studies. These focus on identifying the underlying abstractions and deriving a class hierarchy from them. Finally, the support for OOP concepts that the C++ and Eiffel programming languages provide, as used in the case studies, is discussed.

437	OODP	Object oriented reconstruction software for the Instrumented Flux Return of BABAR	BABAR experiment is the first High Energy Physics experiment to extensively use object oriented technology and the C++ programming language for online and offline software. Object orientation permits to reach a high level of flexibility and maintainability of the code, which is a key point in a large project with many developers. These goals are reached with the introduction of reusable code elements, with abstraction of code behaviours and polymorphism. Software design, before code implementation, is the key task that determines the achievement of such a goal. We present the experience with the application of object oriented technology and design patterns to the reconstruction software of the Instrumented Flux Return detector of BABAR experiment. The use of abstract interfaces improved the development of reconstruction code and permitted to flexibly apply modification to reconstruction strategies, and eventually to reduce the maintenance load. The experience during the last years of development is prese nted. An iterative review and improvement of the design has been strategically applied to the code areas which showed to be, on the basis of experience, more delicate.

438	OODP	Object technology in perspective	Since its beginnings half a century ago, the technology applied to the development of software has continually evolved. Object technology is the result of a long progression of improvements, from the closed subroutine, through structured development techniques and data abstractions, to object-oriented languages, design patterns, and frameworks. In this essay, the author reflects on this evolution, specifically in the areas of development productivity, software maintainability, and paradigm consistency.		G.

439	OODP	Object technology: a general overview	Object technology is a new software paradigm which is rapidly gaining acceptance as a better method for software development. This is particularly important as software systems become larger, more complex and more difficult to maintain, extend and manage. For software developers, the use of object technology can improve the rate of development whilst for users it will progressively offer the potential for open integration or interoperability. This paper provides a brief outline of object technology, describing the various mechanisms which are used in the development of object oriented software and the benefits which are derived from their use. Differences in the use of the object paradigm in comparison with other approaches are outlined from a historical context. Techniques used in the design and development of object technology are highlighted together with the reasons for their use, particularly in the context of conceptual developments which can include domain experts.

440	OODP	Object-based information retrieval model: Toward the structural construction of thesauri	In this paper, we propose an information retrieval model, where the object-oriented paradigm is applied to the construction of thesauri and the interpretation of user queries. This model provides a mechanism to assist domain experts in constructing thesauri; it determines a considerable part of relationship degrees between term objects by inheritance, and supplies domain experts with information available from a thesaurus being constructed. It enables domain experts to incrementally construct thesaurus as well, since the automatically determined degree of relationships can be refined whenever a more sophisticated thesaurus is needed. It may minimize domain expert's burden caused from exhaustive specification of individual relationships. All the relationships between term objects of our thesaurus (called object-based thesaurus) are represented in terms of two levels: concept level and instance level. The former defines the relationships between concepts, whereas the latter specifies the relationships between instances. We also propose a new query evaluation mechanism to exploit the thesaurus when interpreting the intent of user queries.

441	OODP	Object-functional patterns: Re-thinking development in a post-functional world	Programing paradigms define how to think and design while creating software. Object-Oriented and Functional paradigms are two of the most adopted for synthesizing it. Modern languages, attempting to provide higher abstractions, are increasingly supporting native multi-paradigm programming styles.

444	OODP	Object-Oriented Description Japanese OODJ and its description environment	To improve the system (program) development ability of the domain users in various scientific/engineering fields, we have developed a new description language called the OODJ (Object-Oriented Description Japanese) based on the native mother language (Japanese) in the target analysis processes. We have introduced and designed a new set of the description model and the syntax based on the object-oriented paradigm as a description framework with the aid of the object-oriented description support environment. Some typical description examples have been made by some domain users and evaluated. As the results, we have confirmed that the OODJ have realized the object-oriented-structured descriptions, and that the description abilities of the OODJ become higher than the original Japanese. The description support environment has been confirmed to be rather useful for the domain users. The comparisons with other languages are performed and discussed mainly with the UML. We can finally conclude that the OODJ is one of the most useful and valid description language for the domain users.		Hatakeyama, M. (1); Katougi, K.; Ishii, Y.

447	OODP	Object-oriented design of graph oriented data structures	Applied research in graph algorithms and combinatorial structures needs comprehensive and versatile software libraries. However, the design and the implementation of flexible libraries are challenging activities. Among the other problems involved in such a difficult field, a very special role is played by graph classification issues. We propose new techniques devised to help the designer and the programmer in the development activities. Such techniques are especially suited for dealing with graph classification problems and rely on an extension of the usual object-oriented paradigm. In order to support the usage of our approach, we devised an extension of the C++ programming language and implemented the corresponding pre-compiler.

    abstract = ""Applied research in graph algorithms and combinatorial structures needs comprehensive and versatile software libraries. However, the design and the implementation of flexible libraries are challenging activities. Among the other problems involved in such a difficult field, a very special role is played by graph classification issues. We propose new techniques devised to help the designer and the programmer in the development activities. Such techniques are especially suited for dealing with graph classification problems and rely on an extension of the usual object-oriented paradigm. In order to support the usage of our approach, we devised an extension of the C++ programming language and implemented the corresponding pre-compiler. (c) Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999."",

448	OODP	Object-oriented design: A goal-driven and pattern-based approach	In recent years, the influences of design patterns on software quality have attracted increasing attention in the area of software engineering, as design patterns encapsulate valuable knowledge to resolve design problems, and more importantly to improve the design quality. One of the key challenges in object-oriented design is how to apply appropriate design patterns during the system development. In this paper, design pattern is analyzed from different perspectives to see how it can facilitate design activities, handle non-functional requirement, solve design problems and resolve design conflicts. Based on the analysis, various kinds of applicability of design patterns are explored and integrated with a goal-driven approach to guiding developers to construct the object-oriented design model in a systematic manner.

450	OODP	Object-Oriented Implementation of Algebraic Multi-grid Solver for Lattice QCD on SIMD Architectures and GPU Clusters	A portable implementation of elaborated algorithm is important to use variety of architectures in HPC applications. In this work we implement and benchmark an algebraic multi-grid solver for Lattice QCD on three different architectures, Intel Xeon Phi, Fujitsu A64FX, and NVIDIA Tesla V100, in keeping high performance and portability of the code based on the object-oriented paradigm. Some parts of code are specific to an architecture employing appropriate data layout and tuned matrix-vector multiplication kernels, while the implementation of abstract solver algorithm is common to all architectures. Although the performance of the solver depends on tuning of the architecture-dependent part, we observe reasonable scaling behavior and better performance than the mixed precision BiCGSstab solvers.

452	OODP	3D behavioral model design for simulation and software engineering	"Modeling is used to build structures that serve as surrogates for other objects. As children, we learn to model at a very young age. An object such as a small toy train teaches us about the structure and behavior of an actual train. VRML is a file standard for representing the structure of objects such as trains, while the behavior would be represented in a computer language such as ECMAScript or Java. VRML is an abbreviation for Virtual Reality Modeling Language [2], which represents the standard 3D language for the web. Our work is to extend the power of VRML so that it is used not only for defining shape models, but also for creating structures for behavior. ""Behavior shapes"" are built using metaphors mapped onto wellknown dynamic model templates such as finite state machines, functional block models and Petri nets. The low level functionality of the design still requires a traditional programming language, but this level is hidden underneath a modeling level that is visualized by the user. We have constructed a methodology called rube which provides guidelines on building behavioral structures in VRML. The result of our endeavors has yielded a set of VRML Prototypes that serve as dynamic model templates.

    abstract = ""Modeling is used to build structures that serve as surrogates for other objects. As children, we learn to model at a very young age. An object such as a small toy train teaches us about the structure and behavior of an actual train. VRML is a file standard for representing the structure of objects such as trains, while the behavior would be represented in a computer language such as ECMAScript or Java. VRML is an abbreviation for Virtual Reality Modeling Language [2], which represents the standard 3D language for the web. Our work is to extend the power of VRML so that it is used not only for defining shape models, but also for creating structures for behavior. ""Behavior shapes"" are built using metaphors mapped onto wellknown dynamic model templates such as finite state machines, functional block models and Petri nets. The low level functionality of the design still requires a traditional programming language, but this level is hidden underneath a modeling level that is visualized by the user. We have constructed a methodology called rube which provides guidelines on building behavioral structures in VRML. The result of our endeavors has yielded a set of VRML Prototypes that serve as dynamic model templates. We demonstrate several examples of behaviors using primitive shape and architectural metaphors."",

454	OODP	Object-oriented similarity measures for semantic web service matchmaking	The semantic annotation of Web services capabilities with ontological information aims at providing the necessary infrastructure for facilitating efficient and accurate service discovery. The main idea is to apply reasoning techniques over semantically enhanced Web service requests and advertisements in order to determine Web services that meet certain requirements. In this paper we present our work for introducing similarity measures inspired from the domain of Object-Oriented paradigm for ontology concept matching. Our work focuses on the utilization of such measures over an Object-Oriented schema that is created through mapping rules of OWL constructs and semantics into the Object-Oriented model. The goal of the approach is to combine the Object-Oriented representation of the information and the reasoning over OWL semantics in order to enhance the retrieval of semantically relevant, to some criteria, Web services.

456	OODP	Objects and synchronous programming	Clear structure, support for abstraction, reuse, and easy evolution, these are the striking features of the object-oriented approach. Formal description of the reactive behavior, making it possible to prove logical correctness, is the essence of synchronous paradigm. This paper proposes to combine these two approaches. An introductory example presents the notion of a synchronous object. Then, various issues related to objects and synchrony are addressed. Finally, we report on our progress in building a complete design and programming environment. Editors, compilers, simulators, and interface reward model checkers are integrated within this environment, which should contribute to better software quality in the field of real-time systems.

457	OODP	OBSERVING THE OBSERVERS	A design pattern is composed of a problem, the context of the problem, and a solution bundled up and ready to use. Every pattern is given a simple, memorable name to help designers communicate their ideas more easily when using patterns. The author describes the Observer pattern and shows how it can be implemented in Delphi, and explores some programming techniques based on using interfaces. The problem that the Observer pattern solves is that of defining a one-to-many relationship between objects such that when one object changes state, many other objects are notified and updated automatically. The context is that of having many different objects react to changes in one other object.

458	OODP	Off-the-Person Electrocardiography	Electrocardiography (ECG) methods are still mostly bound to hospital and short-time data acquisition settings. Still a paradigm shift is emerging, in which everday technology is increasingly capable of measuring ECG signals in a more pervasive manner. This is paving the way for systems that can better analyze and adapt to perceived changes in the health status or behavior of the user. In the paper we present a taxonomy for the intrusiveness of ECG data acquisition systems, describe a sensor design for what we call the ``off-the-person{''} approach and provide a discussion of the main challenges posed by these new methodologies. Our work is targeted at pervasive electrocardiography through signal acquisition at the hand palms or fingers, by providing a simplified sensor setup that can be integrated into virtgually any object with which the person interacts with.

460	OODP	On applying coordinated atomic actions and dependable software architectures for developing complex systems	Modern concurrent and distributed applications are becoming increasingly complex; so, in order to provide fault tolerance, special structuring mechanisms are required to help reduce this complexity. Unfortunately, such structuring techniques are mostly introduced as design and implementation features, which complicates their employment.

461	OODP	On binary driven hypernovae and their nested late X-ray emission	"The induced gravitational collapse (IGC) paradigm addresses energetic (1052-1054 erg), long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated to supernovae (SNe) and proposes as their progenitors tight binary systems composed of an evolved FeCO core and a companion neutron star (NS). Their emission is characterized by four specific episodes: Episode 1, corresponding to the on-set of the FeCO SN explosion and the accretion of the ejecta onto the companion NS; Episode 2, related the collapse of the companionNS to a black hole (BH) and to the emission of a long GRB; Episode 3, observed in X-rays and characterized by a steep decay, a plateau phase and a late power-law decay; Episode 4, corresponding to the optical SN emission due to the 56Ni decay. We focus on Episode 3 and we show that, from the thermal component observed during the steep decay of the prototype GRB 090618, the emission region has a typical dimension of ~1013 cm, which is inconsistent with the typical size of the emitting region of GRBs, e.g., ~1016 cm. We propose, therefore, that the X-ray afterglow emission originates from a spherically symmetric SN ejecta expanding at G ~ 2 or, possibly, from the accretion onto the newly formed black hole, and we name these systems ""binary driven hypernovae"" (BdHNe). This interpretation is alternative to the traditional afterglow model based on the GRB synchrotron emission from a collimated jet outflow, expanding at ultra-relativistic Lorentz factor of G ~ 102-103 and originating from the collapse of a single object. We show then that the rest-frame energy band 0.3-10 keV X-ray luminosities of three selected BdHNe, GRB 060729, GRB 061121, and GRB 130427A, evidence a precisely constrained ""nested"" structure and satisfy precise scaling laws between the average prompt luminosity, <Liso> , and the luminosity at the end of the plateau, La, as functions of the time at the end of the plateau.

463	OODP	On load balancing for distributed multiagent computing	Multiagent computing on a cluster of workstations is widely envisioned to be a powerful paradigm for building useful distributed applications. The agents of the system span across all the machines of a cluster. Just like the case of traditional distributed systems, load balancing becomes an area of concern. With different characteristics between ordinary processes and agents, it is both interesting and useful to investigate whether conventional load-balancing strategies are also applicable and sufficient to cope with the newly emerging needs, such as coping with temporally continuous agents, devising a performance metric for multiagent systems, and taking into account the vast amount of communication and interaction among agent. This paper discusses the above issues with reference to agent properties and load balancing techniques and outlines the space of load-balancing design choices in the arena of multiagent computing. In view of the special agent characteristics, a novel communication-based load-balancing algorithm is proposed, implemented, and evaluated. The proposed algorithm works by associating a credit value with each agent. The credit of an agent depends on its affinity to a machine, its current workload, its communication behavior, and mobility, etc. When a load imbalance occurs, the credits of all agents are examined and an agent with a lower credit value is migrated to relatively lightly loaded machine in the system. Quasi-simulated experiments of this algorithm show load-balancing improvement compared with conventional workload-oriented load-balancing schemes.

464	OODP	On manipulation planning	An emerging paradigm in solving the classical motion planning problem (among static obstacles) is to capture the connectivity of the configuration space using a finite (but possibly large) set of landmarks (or nodes) in it. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to manipulation planning problem, where the goal is to plan the motion of a robot so that it can move a given object from an initial configuration to a final configuration while avoiding collisions with the static obstacles in the environment. Our specific approach adapts Adraine's Clew Algorithm that has been shown effective for classical motion planning problem. In our approach, landmarks are placed in lower dimensional sub-manifolds of the composite configuration space. These landmarks represent stable grasps that are reachable from the initial configuration. From each new landmark, the planner attempts to reach the goal configuration by executing a local planner, again in a lower (but different) dimensional submanifold of the composite configuration space. We have implemented this approach and present initial experiments with a simple 2-dof planar arm among polygonal obstacles. This simplified domain allows us to better understand the approach.

465	OODP	On model typing	Where object-oriented languages deal with objects as described by classes, model-driven development uses models, as graphs of interconnected objects, described by metamodels. A number of new languages have been and continue to be developed for this model-based paradigm, both for model transformation and for general programming using models. Many of these use single-object approaches to typing, derived from solutions found in object-oriented systems, while others use metamodels as model types, but without a clear notion of polymorphism. Both of these approaches lead to brittle and overly restrictive reuse characteristics. In this paper we propose a simple extension to object-oriented typing to better cater for a model-oriented context, including a simple strategy for typing models as a collection of interconnected objects. We suggest extensions to existing type system formalisms to support these concepts and their manipulation. Using a simple example we show how this extended approach permits more flexible reuse, while preserving type safety.

466	OODP	On Refining Design Patterns for Smart Contracts	The need for a Blockchain Oriented Software Engineering (BOSE) has been recognized in several research papers. Design Patterns are considered among the main and compelling areas to be developed in BOSE. Anyway, design patterns need to be enhanced with some additional fields to better support the specific needs of Blockchain development. In this paper, we discuss the use of Solidity design patterns applied to a water management use case and we introduce specific fields in their description, aiming at offering to Blockchain developers more support in the critical decisions to build efficient decentralized applications.

467	OODP	On refining XML artifacts	Step-wise refinement is a powerful paradigm for developing a complex program from a simple program by adding features incrementally where each feature is an increment in program functionality. Existing works focus on object-oriented representations such as Java or C++ artifacts. For this paradigm to be brought to the Web, refinement should be realised for XML representations. This paper elaborates on the notion of XML refinement by addressing what and how XML can be refined. These ideas are realised in the XAK language.

468	OODP	On the composition of Java frameworks control-flows	Object oriented programming languages provide, in principle, mechanisms to enhance code reuse. As an effort of designing object oriented software, design patterns and frameworks are recognised as good techniques for reuse. Frameworks are of particular interest as design and code reuse are achieved. Despite of that, most frameworks were designed to be adapted to applications and not to be composed with other frameworks. As a result, problems such as control-flows composition, legacy components composition, frameworks gap, entities overlap and composition of frameworks behaviour arise. The present work is a study on the composition of Java frameworks control-flows, where a third framework is created from two existing ones. With this study, we have checked the potential problems that may appear as two control-flows are composed via message-passing.

469	OODP	On the duality of aspect-oriented and feature-oriented design patterns	Design patterns aim at improving reusability and variability of object-oriented software. Despite a notable success, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has been discussed recently to improve the design pattern implementations. In another line of research it has been noticed that feature-oriented programming (FOP) is related closely to AOP and that FOP suffices in many situations where AOP is commonly used. In this paper we explore the assumed duality between AOP and FOP mechanisms. As a case study we use the aspect-oriented design pattern implementations of Hannemann and Kiczales. We observe that almost all of the 23 aspect-oriented design pattern implementations can be transformed straightforwardly into equivalent feature-oriented design patterns. For further investigations we provide a set of general rules how to transform aspect-oriented programs into feature-oriented programs.

470	OODP	On the formal semantics of speech-act based communication in an agent-oriented programming language	"Research on agent communication languages has typically taken the speech acts paradigm as its starting point. Despite their manifest attractions, speech-act models of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for communication in artificial agent systems. In particular, it has proved to be extremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speech-act based agent communication languages. In part, the problem is that speech-act semantics typically make reference to the ""mental states"" of agents (their beliefs, desires, and intentions), and there is in general no way to attribute such attitudes to arbitrary computational agents. In addition, agent programming languages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract, stand-alone versions, neglecting aspects such as communication primitives. With respect to communication, implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather ad hoc. This paper addresses both of these problems, by giving semantics to speech-act based messages received by an AgentSpeak agent. AgentSpeak is a logic-based agent programming language which incorporates the main features of the PRS model of reactive planning systems. The paper builds upon a structural operational semantics to AgentSpeak that we developed in previous work. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: an extension of our earlier work on the theoretical foundations of AgentSpeak interpreters; a computationally grounded semantics for (the core) performatives used in speech-act based agent communication languages; and a well-defined extension of AgentSpeak that supports agent communication."

473	OODP	On the implementation of dynamic software product lines: An exploratory study	Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) engineering is a paradigm aimed at handling adaptations at runtime. An inherent challenge in DSPL engineering is to reduce the design complexity of adaptable software, particularly in terms of evolution. Existing research only recently started to investigate evolution in this field, but does not assess the impact of different implementations under software quality in evolutionary scenarios. This work presents a characterization of thirteen dynamic variability mechanisms. Based on such characterization, we implemented a DSPL using Object-oriented Programming (OOP) mechanisms. From this implementation, we evidenced that DSPL requires changes and extensions to design, in terms of functionality and adaptation capabilities. Since Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) was well ranked according to characterization and some studies have demonstrated the likely synergies between AOP and DSPL, we decided to compare it with OOP. We empirically evaluated how OOP and AOP could affect source code quality from the viewpoint of an evolving DSPL. As a result, AOP yields better results in terms of size, SoC, cohesion, and coupling measures. Conversely, AOP provides lower change propagation impact. Although the packages in AOP were more susceptible to changes than in OOP, we could indicate that AOP may be a feasible strategy for DSPL implementation.

474	OODP	On the interaction of object-oriented design patterns and programming languages	Design patterns are distilled from many real systems to catalog common programming practice. However, some object-oriented design patterns are distorted or overly complicated because of the lack of supporting programming language constructs or mechanisms. For this paper, we have analyzed several published design patterns looking for idiomatic ways of working around constraints of the implementation language. From this analysis, we lay a groundwork of general-purpose language constructs and mechanisms that, if provided by a statically typed, object-oriented language, would better support the implementation of design patterns and, transitively, benefit the construction of many real systems. In particular, our catalog of language constructs includes subtyping separate from inheritance, lexically scoped closure objects independent of classes, and multimethod dispatch. The proposed constructs and mechanisms are not radically new, but rather are adopted from a variety of languages and programming language research and combined in a new, orthogonal manner. We argue that by describing design patterns in terms of the proposed constructs and mechanisms, pattern descriptions become simpler and, therefore, accessible to a larger number of language communities. Constructs and mechanisms lacking in a particular language can be implemented using paradigmatic idioms. Copyright B) 2019, The Authors. All rights reserved.

475	OODP	On the role of design patterns in quality-driven re-engineering	Design patterns have been widely adopted and well investigated by the software engineering community over the past decade. However, their primary use is still associated with forward engineering and the design phase of the software life-cycle. In this paper, we examine design patterns from a different perspective namely, their classification and usage for software re-engineering and restructuring. Specifically, twenty three design patterns originally presented in the <<Gang of Four>> book are reclassified for re-engineering purposes into two major categories, primitive and complex. Moreover, their relationships and impacts to specific re-engineering objectives are presented in terms of a layered model that is denoted by six different relations namely: uses, refines, conflicts, is-similar-to, combines-with, and requires. The paper also discusses how the classification scheme can be applied for the re-engineering and restructuring of object-oriented systems.

476	OODP	On the use of feature-oriented programming for evolving software product lines - A comparative study	Feature-oriented programming (FOP) is a programming technique based on composition mechanisms, called refinements. It is often assumed that feature-oriented programming is more suitable than other variability mechanisms for implementing Software Product Lines (SPLs). However, there is no empirical evidence to support this claim. In fact, recent research work found out that some composition mechanisms might degenerate the SPL modularity and stability. However, there is no study investigating these properties focusing on the FOP composition mechanisms. This paper presents quantitative and qualitative analysis of how feature modularity and change propagation behave in the context of two evolving SPLs, namely WebStore and MobileMedia. Quantitative data have been collected from the SPLs developed in three different variability mechanisms: FOP refinements, conditional compilation, and object-oriented design patterns. Our results suggest that FOP requires few changes in source code and a balanced number of added modules, providing better support than other techniques for non-intrusive insertions. Therefore, it adheres closer to the Open-Closed principle. Additionally, FOP seems to be more effective tackling modularity degeneration, by avoiding feature tangling and scattering in source code, than conditional compilation and design patterns. These results are based not only on the variability mechanism itself, but also on careful SPL design. However, the aforementioned results are weaker when the design needs to cope with crosscutting and fine-grained features.

477	OODP	On traits and types in a Java-like setting	Both single and multiple class-based inheritance are often inappropriate as a reuse mechanism, because classes play two competing roles. Namely, a class is both a generator of instances and a unit of reuse. Rails are composable pure units of behavior reuse, consisting only of methods, that have been proposed as all add-oil to single class-based inheritance in order to improve reuse. However, adopting traits as all add-on to traditional class-based inheritance is not enough: classes, besides their primary role of generators of instances, still play the competing role of units of reuse. Therefore, a style of programming oriented to reuse is not enforced by the language, but left to the programmer's skills. Traits have been originally proposed in the setting of dynamically typed language. When static typing is also taken into account, the role of unit of reuse and the role of type are competing, too. We argue that, in order to support the development of reusable program components, object oriented programming languages should be designed according to the principle that each software structuring construct must have exactly one role. We propose a realignment of the class-based object-oriented paradigm by presenting programming language features that separate completely the declarations of object type, behavior and generator. We illustrate our proposal through a, core calculus and prove the soundness of the type system w.r.t. the operational semantics.	type system; inheritance; composition; flattening; type system;  inheritance;  composition;  flattening	Bono, Viviana; Damiani, Ferruccio; Giachino, Elena	FIFTH IFIP INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE - TCS 2008	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000258429400025		367-382	"""@inproceedings{WOS:000258429400025,

478	OODP	On-demand rapid transport and stable trapping of nanoparticles of nanoparticles by a hybrid electrothermoplasmonic nanotweezer (Conference Presentation)	Summary form only given. In plasmon nano-optical tweezers, plasmonic nanoantennas are illuminated to generate highly localized and enhanced electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the nanoantenna. The highly localized and enhanced electromagnetic field creates much stronger optical gradient forces and tighter potential wells for confining particles than in conventional optical tweezers, thus providing a means to trap nanoscale objects and molecules. This approach have been successfully applied for trapping small particles such as protein molecules. However a long standing problem in this field is how to rapidly load the potential well without relying on Brownian diffusion. Conventional design rely on Brownian diffusion to load the trap, which is very slow and could take several minutes to hours depending on the concentration of the nanoscale objects. Furthermore since the plasmonic trapping sites are pre-patterned on a substrate, current plasmonic nanotweezers suffer from the problem of lack of dynamic control over the particles in the trap. Recently we have addressed these challenges by introducing a novel design paradigm known as the Hybrid Electrothermoplasmonic Nanotweezer (HENT)1, where the intrinsic photo-induced heating of the plasmonic nanoantenna is combined with an applied AC electric field to induce a large scale microfluidic flow on-demand. The microfluidic flow enables rapid delivery of suspended nanoparticles to an illuminated plasmonic nanoantenna where they are trapped within a few seconds. In this talk I will discuss the working principle of HENT, as well as HENT-based nanotweezers utilizing alternative plasmonic materials.

481	OODP	OO choices for business	In today's fast-moving, competitive business environment, corporates face constant pressure to improve the quality of products and services, increase operating efficiencies and reduce costs. To meet these business objectives, corporate computer systems architectures have undergone radical changes over recent years, with an increasing number of organisations embracing client/server as the computing paradigm of the 90s. However, programming techniques have evolved much more slowly, often slowing down the rate of change or at worst, stopping it in its tracks. The paper considers object oriented choices for business.

482	OODP	OO design patterns, design structure, and program changes: An industrial case study	A primary expected benefit of object-oriented (OO) methods is the creation of software systems that are easier to adapt and maintain. OO design patterns are especially geared to improve adaptability, since patterns generally increase the complexity of an initial design in order to ease future enhancements. For design patterns to really provide benefit, they must reduce the cost of future adaptation. The evidence of improvements in adaptability through the use of design patterns and other design structures consists primarily of intuitive arguments and examples. There is little empirical evidence to support claims of improved flexibility of these preferred structures. In this case study, we analyze 39 versions of an evolving industrial OO software system to see if there is a relationship between patterns, other design attributes, and the number of changes. We found a strong relationship between class size and the number of changes - larger classes were changed more frequently. We also found two relationships that we did not expect: (1) classes that participate in design patterns are not less change prone - these pattern classes are among the most change prone in the system, and (2) classes that are reused the most through inheritance tend to be more change prone. These unexpected results hold up after accounting for class size, which had the strongest relationship with changes.

483	OODP	OO migration and software process improvement	The successful experience of Nautronix Ltd. in migrating to an Object-Oriented software development paradigm has been largely due to b_x001C_humanb_x001D_ factors rather than technological ones. A major advantage that has also accrued from the migration is a set of codified procedures that define the software development process. As with most process improvement efforts, empowering and encouraging the engineers to drive the migration process and establishing an identifiable b_x001C_ethosb_x001D_ proved decisive.		Read, D.

This article describes our adaptive Web server, OpenWebServer, which uses the Reflection architectural pattern. The server supports the dynamic adoption of functionality, such as introducing additional protocols, modifying execution policies, and tuning system performance. This is achieved by specifying and coordinating metaobjects that represent various aspects within the Web server. We present a Java version of OpenWebServer, and describe its design using Reflection and other design patterns: Singleton, Bridge, Mediator, Observer, and Decorator.

485	OODP	Optimal software release problems based on a stochastic differential equation model for distributed development environment	Object-oriented software design and analysis contribute to the development of complex software systems. Also the distributed software development paradigm based on the methodology will steadily grow in the future, because this technique is expected as a very effective approach to improve software quality, productivity and reliability. In this paper, we focus on optimal software release problems based on a stochastic differential equation model for the distributed software development environment. Then, we can derive a probability distribution for the total software cost. Especially, we discuss the upper and lower confidence limits for the optimal software release time minimizing the cost.

We evaluate thismethodology by implementing an instance, combining a model-based transformation for data reuse with pattern-based transformations to improve its output. Results for three benchmarks show the implemented framework can improve system performance by up to 57 times.

488	OODP	Parametric aspects: a proposal	Aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) provides better design solutions to problems where object oriented development produces tangled and scattered designs. Nevertheless, there are still several problems for which AOSD is not helpful. An example is the implementation of some design patterns. While it has been shown that some of them can be implemented in a domain-independent way by the use of AOSD [J. Hannemann et al. (2002)], there is still a group of them for which current AOSD techniques are of little use. This paper proposes to extend aspect oriented languages with parametric aspects. This extension can integrate seamlessly into aspect oriented languages like AspectJ, and allows to provide a better design solution for problems for which current AOSD techniques are of little help, improving software reuse and reducing its complexity, thus facilitating the software evolution process. Two representative examples are used in order to expose the proposed extension: the implementation of the abstract factory pattern in a domain-independent way, and that of a simple Enterprise Java Bean.

489	OODP	PATHOS--a paradigmatic approach to high-level object-oriented software development	The growing complexity of information systems and the ensuring problems of their development, maintenance and management have highlighted the inadequacy of formal and informal methods for constructing such systems. These problems manifest themselves in the computer systems which are often unmanageable, unreliable, inflexible and hence difficult to maintain. Users have often demanded for reliable computer systems because they realize that most failures are due to poor specification, and design. This has resulted in the emergence of a number of information systems methodologies together with associated computerized development environments in which the Object-Oriented (OO) approach is one of the most recent.OO is often used for promoting software development and its reuse. Languages like Smalltalk reduce not only development time but also the cost of maintenance, simplifying the creation of new systems and the reuse of old ones. Nevertheless OO is not a panacea i.e. efforts are to put in for its proper use. Thus we consider OO as a paradigm which provides a new image, a new way of conceptualizing the development life cycle. By the help of paradigms, software developers and users are supported in apprehending the development life cycle and means to organize the aspects of the life cycle into a comprehensive method.PATHOS (A Paradigmatic Approach To High-level Object-Oriented Software development) aims to demonstrate an approach to information system development that will lead not only to good information system creation, but also to explicitly represent the maintenance of the business knowledge so as to allow for its more effective and active exploitation at run time.

491	OODP	Pattern oriented service development for coarse-grained service reuse	Service-oriented software development is becoming a prominent paradigm by which web-based applications can be easily assembled and delivered much faster than traditional approaches. Existing service development methods have not addressed the issue of service reuse of varying levels of granularity yet. This paper introduces the concept of service component that packages together web services and choreography, and presents their operations and properties in a consistent and uniform manner.

492	OODP	Pattern writer's workshop	Patterns have fostered one of the fastest-growing communities of interest in contemporary software design. Like many emergent software techniques of recent history-structured programming, data abstraction, and objects-they have captured the imagination of much of the industry. We present a tutorial-like overview on patterns for object-oriented software development. We talk about the history of patterns and try to sketch what patterns are. To be concrete, we present various examples of well-known patterns of all levels of abstraction and granularity. From high level architectural patterns, like the Broker architecture, over medium sized design patterns, such as Observer and Strategy, down to language specific idioms, like the Counted Pointer idiom. To illustrate how patterns help to build high quality software with defined properties, we present a concrete example where different patterns are applied and combined.

493	OODP	Pattern-based refactoring shrinks maintenance costs	Once fielded, software systems enter the maintenance phase of their life cycle. During this phase, changes will be made to improve a system's functionality. An emphasis on functionality alone can lead to a situation where structural qualities assume a lower priority. Software developed under these conditions can, over time, become more difficult, and therefore more costly, to maintain. This paper presents the results of a recent effort by The Boeing Company to improve the data recording and extraction capability of a large Ada 95 Command, Control and Communications (C3) system. It shows how the reliability and structural qualities of the software were improved using the software engineering perspectives of design patterns and refactoring. These improvements led in turn to a high level of maintenance-phase productivity for current and future work.

494	OODP	Pattern-oriented reengineering of a network system	Reengineering is to reorganize and modify existing systems to enhance them or to make them more maintainable. Reengineering is usually necessary as systems evolve due to changes in requirements, technologies, and/or personnel. Design patterns capture recurring structures and dynamics among software participants to facilitate reuse of successful designs. Design patterns are common and well studied in network systems. In this project, we reengineer part of a network system with some design patterns to support future evolution and performance improvement. We start with reverse engineering effort to understand the system and recover its high level architecture. Then we apply concurrent and networked design patterns to restructure the main sub-system. Those patterns include Half-Sync/Half-Async, Monitor Object, and Scoped Locking idiom. The resulting system is more maintainable and has better performance.	reverse engineering; reengineering; design patterns; networked and concurrent software; refactoring; reverse engineering;  reengineering;  design patterns;  networked and concurrent software;  refactoring	Lung, CH; Zhao, Q	7TH WORLD MULTICONFERENCE ON SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS, VOL VI, PROCEEDINGS	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000189331000056		300-305	"""@inproceedings{WOS:000189331000056,

495	OODP	Patterns for mapping OO applications to relational databases	As object oriented languages become more widely used, many people are faced with the integration between those languages and relational databases. The OO and the relational paradigms are excessively different, and it seems almost impossible to reconcile them in a reasonable way. There is a good reason for that: the two paradigms have roots in different sets of principles, and they were created with different purposes in mind. This problem is not as serious as it seems to be at first glance. We describe different approaches to help people tackle this problem in an orderly manner. We also discuss the tradeoff associated with each approach.		Antenangeli, A.

496	OODP	Pattern of agent interaction scenarios as use case maps	"A use case map (UCM) presents, in general, an abstract description of a complex system and, as such, is a good candidate for representing scenarios of autonomous agents interacting with other autonomous agents. The ""gang of four"" design patterns are intended for object-oriented software development but at least eight of the patterns illustrate structure, or architecture, that is appropriate for interacting agents, independent of software development. This study presents these particular patterns in the form of UCMs to describe abstract scenarios of agent interaction. Seven of the patterns attempt to balance the decentralized nature of interacting agents with an organized structure that makes for better, cleaner interactions. An example performance analysis is provided for one of the patterns, illustrating the benefit of an early abstraction of complex agent behavior. The original contribution here is a UCM presentation of the causal paths in agent behavior as suggested by software design patterns."

497	OODP	Pegasus: First steps toward a naturalistic programming language	In this article a new programming paradigm is discussed: naturalistic programming. Naturalistic Programming means writing computer programs with the help of natural language.The authors are convinced that contemporary programming techniques have reached a level where only a fundamental change of paradigm can develop them any further.Introducing, philosophical and epistemological issues related to programming and human thinking are discussed.After that, the programming language Pegasus is presented. It has been developed as a scientific prototype of a naturalistic programming language at the Darmstadt University of Technology.Pegasus can read natural language and create executable program files from that. In addition to that, Pegasus can automatically translate programs between different natural languages, by the time of writing: German and English.Subsequently, an overview on related work is given, followed by remarks on the advantages and disadvantages of naturalistic programming in general and Pegasus in particular.Finally, an outlook on future research concludes.

    abstract = ""In this article a new programming paradigm is discussed: naturalistic programming. Naturalistic Programming means writing computer programs with the help of natural language.The authors are convinced that contemporary programming techniques have reached a level where only a fundamental change of paradigm can develop them any further.Introducing, philosophical and epistemological issues related to programming and human thinking are discussed.After that, the programming language Pegasus is presented. It has been developed as a scientific prototype of a naturalistic programming language at the Darmstadt University of Technology.Pegasus can read natural language and create executable program files from that. In addition to that, Pegasus can automatically translate programs between different natural languages, by the time of writing: German and English.Subsequently, an overview on related work is given, followed by remarks on the advantages and disadvantages of naturalistic programming in general and Pegasus in particular.Finally, an outlook on future research concludes."",

499	OODP	Permission assurance for semantic aspects of design patterns	A pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Programmers use patterns to produce effective and reliable software systems. However, pattern-related information usually reflects high-level user intentions that might not be available in source code when the coding process has been completed. Without proper documentation, those patterns may be concealed or destroyed during software maintenance and evolution. Being conscious of pattern occurrences can help understand source code and thereby provide deeper insight into a software product. In this paper, we argue that one should properly annotate object-oriented design patterns in source code and verify the consistency between patterns and code. This idea is demonstrated with the Singleton as well as the Strategy pattern, and we show how to assure some semantic aspects of these two patterns using a permission type system.

500	OODP	Per-pixel vs. object-based classification of urban land cover extraction using high spatial resolution imagery	In using traditional digital classification algorithms, a researcher typically encounters serious issues in identifying urban land cover classes employing high resolution data. A normal approach is to use spectral information alone and ignore spatial information and a group of pixels that need to be considered together as an object. We used QuickBird image data over a central region in the city of Phoenix, Arizona to examine if an object-based classifier can accurately identify urban classes. To demonstrate if spectral information alone is practical in urban classification, we used spectra of the selected classes from randomly selected points to examine if they can be effectively discriminated. The overall accuracy based on spectral information alone reached only about 63.33%. We employed five different classification procedures with the object-based paradigm that separates spatially and spectrally similar pixels at different scales. The classifiers to assign land covers to segmented objects used in the study include membership functions and the nearest neighbor classifier. The object-based classifier achieved a high overall accuracy (90.40%), whereas the most commonly used decision rule, namely maximum likelihood classifier, produced a lower overall accuracy (67.60%). This study demonstrates that the object-based classifier is a significantly better approach than the classical per-pixel classifiers. Further, this study reviews application of different parameters for segmentation and classification, combined use of composite and original bands, selection of different scale levels, and choice of classifiers. Strengths and weaknesses of the object-based prototype are presented and we provide suggestions to avoid or minimize uncertainties and limitations associated with the approach.

502	OODP	Photo-based estimators for the nevada photo-based inventory	The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis Program conducted the Nevada Photo-Based Inventory Pilot in an effort to improve precision in estimates of forest parameters, reduce field data collection costs on margin lands that are covered by slow growing woodland species, and address the potential of strategic-level inventory on lands not traditionally sampled. One part of the project involved the use of large-scale aerial photography instead of traditional field plot visits to produce three types of estimates: (1) area by a variety of forest and nonforest types; (2) percent cover of object types in the landscape; and (3) percent cover of object types within forest or nonforest type. In the context of the infinite sampling paradigm and using the support region construct, we construct the estimators used in the project, derive the variance of the estimator, and give an unbiased estimate of the variance.

One part of the project involved the use of large-scale aerial photography instead of traditional field plot visits to produce three types of estimates: (1) area by a variety of forest and nonforest types; (2) percent cover of object types in the landscape; and (3) percent cover of object types within forest or nonforest type. In the context of the infinite sampling paradigm and using the support region construct, we construct the estimators used in the project, derive the variance of the estimator, and give an unbiased estimate of the variance.

503	OODP	Piccola-a small composition language	Summary form only given, as follows. Although object-oriented languages are well-suited to implementing software components, they fail to shine in the construction of component-based applications, largely because object-oriented design tends to obscure a component-based architecture. We propose to tackle this problem by clearly separating component implementation and composition. Piccola is a small b_x001C_composition languageb_x001D_ that embodies the paradigm of b_x001C_applications=components+scriptsb_x001D_. Piccola models components and composition abstractions by means of a unifying foundation of communicating concurrent agents. Flexibility and extensibility are obtained by modelling both interfaces to components and the contexts in which they live, by means of extensible records or b_x001C_formsb_x001D_. We illustrate the realization of an architectural style in Piccola and show how external components may be adapted and composed according to the style. We show how separating components from their composition can improve maintainability.		Nierstrasz, O. (1)	Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantics of Objects as Processes.

504	OODP	PLASH: An ESB-based platform for developing and deploying location aware services with SOC concepts	PLASH, Platform for Location Aware Service with Human Computation, is a location aware service (LAS) development and provision platform designed to satisfy particular needs encountered in geospatial researches and areas in pervasive computing. The generalized requirements are: supporting heterogeneous clients, working with heterogeneous service providers, providing open development and facilitating development. The design of PLASH heavily adopts concepts from service-oriented component model (SOCM) and improves some of the concepts to make the platform suit LAS development. SOCM is a hybrid approach that infuses service-oriented principles into component oriented model. This paper adopted such paradigm to take advantage of several important SOCM features and features inherited from service oriented computing (SOC). The features include allowing service heterogeneity, simplifying development model and dynamism. The PLASH realizes the design by building components on an enterprise service bus. The design of PLASH has served as a model for approaching problems that can be characterized by the aforementioned requirements. Finally, we introduce two practical case studies to verify the reasonability and feasibility of this work.

505	OODP	Plateau de Bure interferometer observations of the disk and outflow of HH 30	Context. HH 30 is a well-known Pre-Main-Sequence star in Taurus. HST observations have revealed a flared, edge-on disk driving a highly-collimated optical jet, making this object a case study for the disk-jet-outflow paradigm. Aims. We searched for a molecular outflow, and attempted to better constrain the star and disk parameters. Methods. We obtained high angular resolution (~1'') observations of the dust continuum at 2.7 and 1.3 mm, and of the 12CO 7 = 2-1, 13CO J = 2-1 and J= 1-0, C18O J= 1 -0 emissions around HH 30. A standard disk model is used to fit the 13CO J = 2-1 uv-plane visibilities and derive the disk properties, and the stellar mass. An ad hoc outflow model is used to reproduce the main properties of the 12CO J = 2-1 emission. Results. The rotation vector of the disk points toward the North-Eastern jet. The disk rotation is Keplerian: using a distance of 140 pc, we deduce a mass of 0.45 M  for the central star. The disk outer radius is 420 AU. A highly asymmetric outflow originates from the inner parts of the disk. Only its North-Eastern lobe was detected: it presents to first order a conical morphology with a 30deg half opening angle and a constant (12 km s-1) radial velocity field. Outflow rotation was searched for but not found. The upper limit of the outflow rotation velocity is 1 km s-1 at 200 AU of the jet axis. Conclusions. HH 30 is a low mass TTauri of spectral type around M1 and age 1 to 4 Myr, surrounded by a medium size Keplerian disk, of mass around 4 x 10-3 M. It beautifully illustrates the jet-disk-outflow interaction, being so far the only star to display a jet and outflow connected to a well defined Keplerian disk, but reveals a surprisingly asymmetric (one-sided) outflow despite a relatively symmetric jet. Furthermore, these observations do not enable to assign the origin of the molecular outflow to entrainment by the optical jet or to a disk wind. In the latter hypothesis, the lack of rotation would imply an origin in the inner 15 AU of the disk.

509	OODP	Precise specification of design pattern structure and behaviour	Applying design patterns while developing a software system can improve its non-functional properties, such as extensibility and loose coupling. Precise specification of structure and behaviour communicates the invariants imposed by a pattern on a conforming implementation and enables formal software verification. Many existing design-pattern specification languages (DPSLs) focus on class structure alone, while those that do address behaviour suffer from a lack of expressiveness and/or imprecise semantics. In particular, in a review of existing work, three invariant categories were found to be inexpressible in state-of-the-art DPSLs: dependency, object state and data-structure. This paper presents Alas: a precise specification language that supports design-pattern descriptions including these invariant categories. The language is based on UML Class and Sequence diagrams with modified syntax and semantics. In this paper, the meaning of the presented invariants is formalized and relevant ambiguities in the UML Standard are clarified. We have evaluated Alas by specifying the widely-used Gang of Four pattern catalog and identified patterns that benefitted from the added expressiveness and semantics of Alas.

510	OODP	Predicting maintenance performance using object-oriented design complexity metrics	The Object-Oriented (OO) paradigm has become increasingly popular in recent years. Researchers agree that, although maintenance may turn out to be easier for OO systems, it is unlikely that the maintenance burden will completely disappear. One approach to controlling software maintenance costs is the utilization of software metrics during the development phase, to help identify potential problem areas. Many new metrics have been proposed for OO systems, but only a few of them have been validated. The purpose of this research is to empirically explore the validation of three existing OO design complexity metrics and, specifically, to assess their ability to predict maintenance time. This research reports the results of validating three metrics, Interaction Level (IL), Interface Size (IS), and Operation Argument Complexity (OAC). A controlled experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of design complexity (as measured by the above metrics) on maintenance time. Each of the three metrics by itself was found to be useful in the experiment in predicting maintenance performance.

511	OODP	Prefetching based on the type-level access pattern in object-relational DBMSs	Prefetching is an effective method for minimizing the number of round-trips between the client and the server in database management systems. We propose new notions of the type-level access locality and the type-level access pattern. We also formally define the notions of capturing and prefetching to help understand the underlying mechanisms. We then develop an efficient prefetching policy based on these notions and the framework. The type-level access locality is a phenomenon that repetitive patterns exist in the attributes referenced. The type-level access pattern is a pattern of attributes that are referenced in accessing the objects. Existing prefetching methods are based on object-level or page-level access patterns, which consist of object-ids or page-ids of the objects accessed. However the drawback of these methods is that they work only when exactly the same objects or pages are accessed repeatedly. In contrast even though the same objects are not accessed repeatedly our technique effectively prefetches objects if the same attributes are referenced repeatedly, i.e., if there is type-level access locality. Many navigational applications in object-relational database management systems (ORDBMSs) have type-level access locality. Therefore, our technique can be employed in ORDBMSs to effectively reduce the number of round trips, thereby significantly enhancing the performance.

512	OODP	PRM inference using Jaffray & Fay's Local Conditioning	"Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) are a framework for compactly representing uncertainties (actually probabilities). They result from the combination of Bayesian Networks (BNs), Object-Oriented languages, and relational models. They are specifically designed for their efficient construction, maintenance and exploitation for very large scale problems, where BNs are known to perform poorly. Actually, in large-scale problems, it is often the case that BNs result from the combination of patterns (small BN fragments) repeated many times. PRMs exploit this feature by defining these patterns only once (the so-called PRM'sclasses) and using them through multipleinstances, as prescribed by the Object-Oriented paradigm. This design induces low construction and maintenance costs. In addition, by exploiting the classes' structures, PRM's state-of-the-art inference algorithm ""Structured Variable Elimination"" (SVE) significantly outperforms BN's classical inference algorithms (e.g., Variable Elimination, VE; Local Conditioning, LC). SVE is actually an extension of VE that simply exploits classes to avoid redundant computations. In this article, we show that SVE can be enhanced using LC. Although LC is often thought as being outperformed by VE-like algorithms in BNs, we do think that it should play an important role for PRMs because its features are very well suited for best exploiting PRM classes. In this article, relying on Fay and Jaffray's works, we show how LC can be used in conjunction with VE and deduce an extension of SVE that outperforms it for large-scale problems. Numerical experiments highlight the practical efficiency of our algorithm."

514	OODP	Processes and knowledge management: a symbiosis	In the Development Center South West the business and engineering processes and the knowledge management system build a symbiosis. The knowledge management system is embedded in the business process model, which has been established for several years. The processes provide the knowledge management with input and support the use of it. The systems manage information objects, which contain the description of knowledge, 'non practices' and 'best practices' of the knowledge management and which have a structure, conceptually based on the quality improvement paradigm. Beside the usual ones (queries, ...) a new kind of information object access is given by the processes, whereas the processes and their activities are attributed with links to the objects. A systematic approach for improving processes is a result of the symbiosis. This article describes the results one year after initializing the symbiosis.		Nagel, C.

516	OODP	Programming for non-volatile main memory is hard	Using non-volatile memory as main memory (NVMM) can largely improve the performance of applications, but adds to the challenge of programming - it turns out to be very error-prone to write real-world NVMM programs, especially with object-oriented programming. This paper presents a field study of erroneous NVMM programs written by programmers who are trained to use a general NVMM programming interface. We performed the field study in a training workshop of 30 participants. Our observations and derived best practices offer a reference for future NVMM programming techniques design. Toward that end, we propose a taxonomy of latest NVMM programming techniques and, accordingly, a set of paradigms that can reduce the risk of NVMM-specific bugs. The paradigms incorporate a minimal NVMM library interface design and a new design pattern inspired by the field study.

517	OODP	Tutorial: Programming multi-agent systems with SARL	Complex software development calls for appropriate high-level features to better and easily tackle the new requirements in terms of interactions, concurrency and distribution. This demands a paradigm change in software engineering and corresponding programming languages. Agent-oriented programming may provide the appropriate support for this change by focusing on a small corpus of commonly accepted concepts and in line with the current developers' programming practices. This tutorial introduces SARL [3, 2], a new general-purpose agent-oriented programming language undertaking this challenge. The main perspective that guided the creation of SARL is the establishment of an open and easily extensible language.

518	OODP	Programming paradigm driven heap analysis	The computational cost and precision of a shape style heap analysis is highly dependent on the way method calls are handled. This paper introduces a new approach to analyzing method calls that leverages the fundamental object-oriented programming concepts of encapsulation and invariants. The analysis consists of a novel partial context-sensitivity heuristic and a new take on cutpoints that, in practice, provide large improvements in interprocedural analysis performance while having minimal impacts on the precision of the results. The interprocedural analysis has been implemented for .Net bytecode and an existing abstract heap model. Using this implementation we evaluate both the runtime cost and the precision of the results on a number of well known benchmarks and real-world programs. Our experimental evaluations show that, despite the use of partial context sensitivity heuristics, the static analysis is able to precisely approximate the ideal analysis results. Further, the results show that the interprocedural analysis heuristics and the approach to cutpoints used in this work are critical in enabling the analysis of large real-world programs, over 30K bytecodes in less than 65 seconds and using less than 130 MB of memory, and which could not be analyzed with previous approaches.

Further, the results show that the interprocedural analysis heuristics and the approach to cutpoints used in this work are critical in enabling the analysis of large real-world programs, over 30K bytecodes in less than 65 seconds and using less than 130 MB of memory, and which could not be analyzed with previous approaches.

519	OODP	Progress on patterns: highlights of PLoP/94	Software patterns support an emerging family of software design techniques. At the First Annual Conference on Pattern Languages of Programming (PLoP/94), the pattern community refined its understanding of what makes a good software design pattern. Attendees explored and refined patterns in writers' workshops, using techniques borrowed from literature and poetry. Many different pattern forms were found to work well, though most exhibited the basics of the Alexandrian form. There was a disproportionate representation of patterns for distributed processing, client/server architectures and finite state machines. These are all maturing domains, for which patterns capture established good practice. Good patterns aren't necessarily inventive, but capture hard-won experience in software domains of broad interest.		Coplien, J.O. (1)	OOP '95.

520	OODP	Promoting social goals through economisation? Social investment and the counterintuitive case of homelessness	Within the welfare state literature, critics of social investment have argued that its economic logic replaces 'social' considerations (for example, focused on rights/needs) and that this could reinforce the marginalisation of vulnerable populations, as they are unattractive 'human capital'. Against this background, this article focuses on the counterintuitive case of the social investment approach to homelessness promoted by the European Commission. Through the comparison with previous EU initiatives in the homelessness field, the analysis reveals that while social investment partially replaces values-based logics with the economic rationale, it involves the same 'solutions' as values-oriented approaches, that is, preventing/combating homelessness can be justified interchangeably following an 'economic' or a 'social' logic. To explain this paradoxical result, the article draws from the political economy literature, which shows how disadvantage can be transformed into an investment object. Overall, this study suggests understanding social investment as a paradigm that attempts to promote the 'social' through its economisation.

521	OODP	Property checking for design patterns	Design patterns have been widely employed as a useful object-oriented technique in software engineering. In this paper, we present an approach to property checking for the application of design patterns in rCOS, which is known as a refinement calculus for object oriented systems. A relational calculus is proposed to specify the pattern properties we would like to check. To construct the abstract model from rCOS instead of analyzing directly on source code, we combine static and dynamic analysis together to achieve better checking efficiency. Class diagrams and object diagrams are obtained with the analysis of rCOS program. The extended operational semantics for rCOS with the object graph is given as the basis for representing object relationships. A general algorithm for calculating relational predicates is presented to perform the property checking. The examples of design patterns from GoF [7], such as abstract factory, builder etc, are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach from which we can tell whether some patterns are used correctly.

The success of existing design patterns encourages researchers and practitioners to propose new design patterns especially for solving recurring design problems in specific domains. Assessing the quality of the design patterns being developed is an important task for a design pattern developer to determine which parts of the patterns need improvement. This paper presents a hierarchical quality model for object-oriented design patterns under development. The model focuses on two quality attributes, i.e. Embedded Knowledge and Pattern Language quality, of the object-oriented design patterns. The model relates several properties of the design pattern descriptions, i.e. usefulness, completeness, consistency, and understandability, to the two quality attributes. Four quality metrics are proposed to quantitatively measure those properties of the design pattern descriptions. In an evaluation, we obtain a satisfactory result as the proposed quality assessment model can be used to complement other existing design pattern evaluation methods.

526	OODP	Range search on uncertain trajectories	The range search on trajectories is fundamental in a wide spectrum of applications such as environment monitoring and location based services. In practice, a large portion of spatio-temporal data in the above applications is generated with low sampling rate and the uncertainty arises between two subsequent observations of a moving object. To make sense of the uncertain trajectory data, it is critical to properly model the uncertainty of the trajectories and develop efficient range search algorithms on the new model. Assuming uncertain trajectories are modeled by the popular Markov Chains, in this paper we investigate the problem of range search on uncertain trajectories. In particular, we propose a general framework for range search on uncertain trajectories following the filtering-and-refinement paradigm where summaries of uncertain trajectories are constructed to facilitate the filtering process. Moreover, statistics based and partition based filtering techniques are developed to enhance the filtering capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our new techniques.

    abstract = ""The range search on trajectories is fundamental in a wide spectrum of applications such as environment monitoring and location based services. In practice, a large portion of spatio-temporal data in the above applications is generated with low sampling rate and the uncertainty arises between two subsequent observations of a moving object. To make sense of the uncertain trajectory data, it is critical to properly model the uncertainty of the trajectories and develop efficient range search algorithms on the new model. Assuming uncertain trajectories are modeled by the popular Markov Chains, in this paper we investigate the problem of range search on uncertain trajectories. In particular, we propose a general framework for range search on uncertain trajectories following the filtering-and-refinement paradigm where summaries of uncertain trajectories are constructed to facilitate the filtering process. Moreover, statistics based and partition based filtering techniques are developed to enhance the filtering capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our new techniques."",

527	OODP	Reclassification of Infectious Disease in the Mondo Disease Ontology	The Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo) represents cross-species diseases, which integrates several source disease terminologies to represent cross-species diseases, and provides precise semantic mappings to the original sources. Mondo spans both rare and 'common' diseases, as well as monogenic, acquired, neoplasms, infectious diseases, and more. Mondo is a community resource and is continuously updated and iteratively curated. Recent efforts sought to improve the representation of viral infectious diseases in Mondo, to properly represent primary infections, diseases caused by reactivation of a latent virus, such as shingles and diseases caused by aftereffects of a primary infection such as long COVID-19. This included the addition of new classes and new relations (object properties), and the creation of new design patterns.

528	OODP	Reducing static dependences exploiting a declarative design patterns framework	Object Oriented Design Patterns (DPs) are recurring solutions to common problems in software design aiming to improve code reusability, maintainability and comprehensibility. Despite such advantages, the adoption of DPs causes the presence of crosscutting code increasing, significantly, the code duplication and the dependencies between systems. The main idea of this research is that code crosscutting can be reduced by the integration of Model Driven Development (MDD) techniques with Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). According to this, an approach based on a Domain Specification Language (DSL) to to define declaratively the structure of DPs and their adoption on classes to declarative, is proposed. The approach aims to support aspects derivation to compose, at run time, AOP-based version of the specified DPs. The approach has been applied in a case study where the developed supporting framework was used in a concrete refactoring scenario, and a subsequent maintenance task. The results from the case study are presented and discussed.

529	OODP	Reducing the gap between business and information systems through complex event processing	According to the Object Management Group, a rule is a proposition that is a claim of obligation or of necessity. The concept of rule is usually employed in the context of business process to manage companies operations. While a workflow is an explicit specification of tasks' execution flow, business rules only impose restrictions on the tasks' execution. This provides a great deal of flexibility for the process execution, since the stakeholders are free to choose an execution flow which does not violate the rules. The execution of a task in a process can be seen as the occurrence of an event, which may enable/disable the execution of some other tasks in the process. Event-driven programming is a paradigm in which the program control-flow is determined by the occurrence of events. The capacity to handle processes that are unpredictably non-linear and dynamic makes the event-driven paradigm an effective solution for the implementation of business rules. However, the connection between the business rules and their implementation through eventdriven programming has been made in an ad-hoc and unstructured manner. This paper proposes a methodology to tackle such a problem by systematically moving from business rules described in natural language toward a concrete implementation of a business process. We use complex event processing (CEP) to implement the process. CEP relies on the event driven paradigm for monitoring and processing events. The methodology allows for the active participation of business people at all stages of the refinement process. Throughout the paper, we show how our methodology was employed to implement the operations of the World Bank.

531	OODP	Refactoring of Crosscutting Concerns with Metaphor-Based Heuristics	"It has been advocated that Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is an effective technique to improve software maintainability through explicit support for modularising crosscutting concerns. However, in order to take the advantages of AOP, there is a need for supporting the systematic refactoring of crosscutting concerns to aspects. Existing techniques for aspect-oriented refactoring are too fine-grained and do not take the concern structure into consideration. This paper presents two categories towards a metaphor-based classification of crosscutting concerns driven by their manifested shapes through a system's modular structure. The proposed categories provide an intuitive and fundamental terminology for detecting concern-oriented design flaws and identifying refactorings in terms of recurring crosscutting structures. On top of this classification, we define a suite of metaphor-based refactorings to guide the ""aspectisation"" of each concern category. We evaluate our technique by classifying concerns of 23 design patterns and by proposing refactorings to aspectise them according to observations made in previous empirical studies. Based on our experience, we also determine a catalogue of potential additional categories and heuristics for refactoring of crosscutting concerns."

532	OODP	Refinement of components in connection-safe assemblies with synchronous and asynchronous communication	Components are strongly encapsulated behaviours which interact with the environment by exchanging messages. Interaction may, amongst others, follow a synchronous rendezvous mechanism for message exchange or an asynchronous paradigm where sending and handling a message happens at different points in time. We extend our previously defined component model by integrating synchronous and asynchronous communication. As the formal background we use I/O-transition systems and consider asynchronous communication with fifo-ordered message buffers. We identify compatibility properties that should be satisfied when components communicate along synchronous and asynchronous connectors. As a first result we show that synchronous compatibility is a sufficient condition to ensure buffered compatibility in asynchronous communications. We introduce the notion of connection-safe assemblies which requires compatibility of both kinds of communication. We define a refinement relation and show its compositionality with respect to synchronous and asynchronous connectors in connection-safe assemblies. Finally, we provide results showing the preservation of connection-safety under component refinement.

533	OODP	Reifying design patterns as metalevel constructs	A design pattern describes a structure of communicating components that solves a commonly occurring design problem. Designing with patterns offers the possibility of raising the abstraction level at which design is performed, with improvements in clarity, understanding, and facility of maintenance of applications. However, in their most common presentation, design patterns are informal pieces of design process, whose application is not reflected in the operational system, and the potential advantages of a more principled design are not realized. This work proposes to organize design in such a way that pattern applications remain explicit in the operational systems. A reflective architecture is proposed where patterns are reified as metalevel constructs.		Marcos, C. (1); Campo, M. (1); Pirotte, A.	ASOO'98. Simposio en Orientacion a Objetos (ASOO'98.

534	OODP	Relaying the High-Frequency Contents of Tactile Feedback to Robotic Prosthesis Users: Design, Filtering, Implementation, and Validation	It is known that high-frequency tactile information conveys useful cues to discriminate important contact properties for manipulation, such as first contact and roughness. Despite this, no practical system, implementing a modality matching paradigm, has been developed so far to convey this information to users of upper-limb prostheses. The main obstacle to this implementation is the presence of unwanted vibrations generated by the artificial limb mechanics, which are not related to any haptic exploration task. In this letter, we describe the design of a digital system that can record accelerations from the fingers of an artificial hand and reproduce them on the user's skin through voice-coil actuators. Particular attention has been devoted to the design of the filter, needed to cancel all those vibrations measured by the sensors that do not convey information on meaningful contact events. The performance of the newly designed filter is also compared with the state of the art. Exploratory experiments with prosthesis users have identified some applications where this kind of feedback could lead to sensory-motor performance enhancement. Results show that the proposed system improves the perception of object-salient features such as first-contact events, roughness, and shape.

535	OODP	Reliable ESB and distributed transactional memory for SOA	Service oriented architecture (SOA) is a paradigm for the realization and maintenance of business processes that span large distributed systems. Organizations often face difficulties when building the IT system based on SOA. The most common problem is poor reliability including service qualities and performance issues. In this article, we propose solutions to the problems described and merge them into a comprehensive architectural model for the reliable services provision in SOA. In order to overcome problems related to poor reliability, our architectural model requires the use of adjusted ESB (Enterprise Service Bus). Furthermore, we propose that all data transfer between web services and backend goes in form of TO (Transactional Objects), which are accessed by transactions in distributed transactional memory and allow us a uniform data access and manipulation, regardless of the data source. As the best approach to improve performances of the data access, our model introduces caching in the system binding with TOs. The proposed model is also loosely coupled, which means that the organizations can use only parts of the whole solution that correspond to their specific needs.

542	OODP	Research on human resource information systems based on requirement engineering	Requirement Engineering (RE) is an important part of the software development life-cycle (SDLC) since the basis for developing successful software depends on initially comprehending its requirements. That is, it acts as the contract between the software users and the developers. Requirement engineering involves a number of processes for gathering requirements in accordance with the needs and demands of users and stakeholders of the software product. Further work needs to be carried out in order to adjust and refine existing measures that satisfy the most critical phases in life-cycle, especially in the architecture and program design phases. In this paper the Human-Resource Information Systems in the Directorate of Vocational Education can be seen as an example of a complex system. Therefore, the paper considers HRIS as a case study for which a software system has been developed taking the Requirement engineering approach into account. Thereafter, HRIS is designed using object oriented analysis and design methodology along with J2EE platform and a few auxiliary technologies like framework Spring helpful in implementation of MVC design pattern and Hibernate facilitating connecting process with a database.

543	OODP	Research on positive and negative incentive method to active individual based on safety management: FRN evidence	In the process of enterprise's safety production, human factor plays a more and more important role. According to the classification of personality psychology, taking the active individual as the research object, through the method of cognitive neuroscience experiment to make a comparative study of the effectiveness of the positive and negative incentives. The experiment based on the evaluation paradigm of responding task results, mainly adopting 'tip - target - feedback' paradigm, through comparing the stimulates from two groups, in the block1,16 participants with active traits were asked to respond to the square of different positions on the screen in the prescriptive time through clicking the key. If the participants click the square before the ending, a coin would be given as a reward; otherwise, no rewards would be given. In the same way, in the block 2, if the participants don't click the square before the ending time, a punishment would be given; otherwise, no punishment would be given. Negative components can be used to analyze the feedback, FRN, reflecting the subjects themselves in the mind of positive incentive method and negative incentive method two kinds of incentive methods to assess potency. The results reflected that positive incentive has more accurate answers than that of negative incentive, and punishment has a more significant FRN waveform than that of reward, when the participants give a right answer, without given a reward has a more significant FRN waveform than that of having a reward. This demonstrates that positive incentive method has a better management effect than negative when it comes to active individual during the safety management.

545	OODP	Research Paradigms of Police Intelligence and Their Integration	The police intelligence is a new independent discipline which is under the impetus of police intelligence practice and theoretical research . Introducing the paradigm theory will help clarify the theoretical basis of police intelligence, reveal its law of development, and promote its development. The police intelligence has gone through four research paradigms, which are secret intelligence, information data, information resources development, intelligence-led policing. These four paradigms represent the important influence of police intelligence, reflect the development process of how police intelligence becomes an independent discipline which differs from information science, and show the development and maturity of the theoretical research of police intelligence. To meet the needs of development of police intelligence's practice and theory, police intelligence research paradigm should be integrated, which is formed by subject dimension, object dimension, workflow dimension and application dimension.

547	OODP	Resolving the black hole causality paradox	The black hole information paradox is really a combination of two problems: the causality paradox and the entanglement problem. The causality paradox arises because in the semiclassical approximation infalling matter gets causally trapped inside its own horizon; it is therefore unable to send its information back to infinity if we disallow propagation outside the light cone. We show how the causality paradox is resolved in the fuzzball paradigm. One needs to distinguish between two kinds of Rindler spaces: (a) Rindler space obtained by choosing accelerating coordinates in Minkowski space and (b) 'pseudo-Rindler' space, which describes the region near the surface of a fuzzball. These two spaces differ in their vacuum fluctuations. While low energy waves propagate the same way on both spaces, infalling objects with energies E T suffer an 'entropy enhanced tunneling' in the pseudo-Rindler spacetime (b); this leads to the nucleation of a fuzzball before the infalling object gets trapped inside a horizon.

548	OODP	Reusability analysis of four standard object-oriented class libraries	Class libraries play a key role in object-oriented paradigm. They provide, by and large, the most commonly reused components in object-oriented environments. In this paper, we use a number of metrics to study reusability of four standard class libraries of two object-oriented languages; namely Java and Eiffel. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate how different design philosophies of the two languages have affected structural design and organization of their standard libraries that in turn might have affected their reusability with regards to Ease of Reuse and Design with Reuse. Our study concludes that within limits of our measurements, the Java libraries are easy to reuse whereas Eiffel libraries are better designed with reuse. We observe that whilst design with reuse may make class libraries extensible and maintainable, but it does not necessarily make them easy to reuse.

550	OODP	Reusable framework for telecontrol protocols	Presents a so-called COMSOFT framework of a communication software development model based on object-oriented architecture and design patterns. The library of reusable components supports reuse in all phases of the development process; it is intended to be generic with respect to the family of telecontrol protocols. The framework is supplemented with customisation guidelines to help in refining the reuseable library so that deriving a working application becomes easier and more systematic. The elaborated solution is based on experience obtained during the development of the IEC-870-5-101 protocol interface for ABB monitoring and control devices.		Cysewski, G. (1); Gromadzki, T.

551	OODP	Reusing patterns through design refinement	Refinement concepts, such as procedural and data refinement, are among the most important ideas of software engineering. In this paper, we investigate the idea of design refinement, the process of refining a set of design patterns to arrive at application-specific design components, and ultimately, to system implementations. The approach also enables designers to refine a given pattern to arrive at more specialized versions of that pattern -sub-patterns- thus enabling the creation of pattern hierarchies. We present three contributions: (i) We explore the concept of design refinement and consider what it means for such a refinement to be correct, in the sense of being faithful to the pattern being refined. (ii) We describe a two-part formalism for documenting patterns and sub-patterns. A pattern contract captures the requirements and behavioral guarantees associated with a given pattern, while a subcontract captures the ways in which the pattern is specialized for use in a particular application or sub-pattern. Contracts and subcontracts serve as the basis for validating the correctness of a given refinement. (iii) We consider how related patterns may be organized into suitable hierarchies based on the notion of design refinement. We focus on variations of the standard Observer pattern as examples. A key feature of our formalism is that while it enables us to specify patterns and sub-patterns precisely, it allows us to do so without compromising their flexibility.

552	OODP	Reverse engineering to the practical architecture using design decision trees	The essence of practical software architecture is in shared knowledge and common culture of software design, based on experience-proven and well-understood solutions to problems recurring in a specific domain. This knowledge may be refined and reused only if explicitly represented in a tangible form, accessible to and used by a wide group of people. We explore an approach to this knowledge using design decision trees (DDT). DDT is a partial ordering of design decisions and a systematic approach to incrementally documenting, refining, organising, and reusing architectural knowledge in the process and product of software design.

555	OODP	ROAC: A role-oriented access control model	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) has become the de facto standard for realizing authorization requirements in a wide range of organizations. Existing RBAC models suffer from two main shortcomings; lack of expressiveness of roles/permissions and ambiguities of their hierarchies. Roles/permissions expressiveness is limited since roles do not have the ability to express behaviour and state, while hierarchical RBAC cannot reflect real organizational hierarchies. In this paper, we propose a novel access control model: The Role-Oriented Access Control Model (ROAC), which is based on the concepts of RBAC but inspired by the object-oriented paradigm. ROAC greatly enhances expressiveness of roles and permissions by introducing parameters and methods as members. The hierarchical ROAC model supports selective inheritance of permissions.

556	OODP	Safe uniform proxies for Java	"The proxy abstraction has a long-lasting tradition in object-oriented programming. From design patterns to inherent programming language support, and from remote method invocations to simple forms of behavioral reflection, incarnations as well as applications of proxies are innumerable. Since version 1.3, Java has supported the concept of a dynamic proxy. Such an object conforms to a set of types specified by the program and can be used wherever an expression of any of these types is expected, yet it reifies invocations performed on it. This ability has allowed dynamic proxies to be used to implement paradigms such as behavioral reflection, structural conformance, or multi-methods. Alas, these proxies are only available ""for interfaces"". The case of creating dynamic proxies for a set of types including a class has not been addressed, meaning that it is currently not possible to create a dynamic proxy that conforms to an application-defined class type. This weakness strongly limits any application of dynamic proxies beyond the inherent limitations of proxies, which have motivated deeper programming language support for features such as behavioral reflection. In this paper, we unfold the current support for dynamic proxies in Java, assessing it in the light of a set of generic criteria for proxy implementations. We present an approach to supporting dynamic proxies ""for classes"", consisting in transformations performed on classes at load-time, including a generic scheme for enforcing encapsulation upon field accesses. These transformations seamlessly extend the scope of the current support for dynamic proxies from the programmer's perspective. We argue for the safety of our transformations, and discuss the precise benefits and costs of our extension in terms of the criteria introduced through an implementation of future method invocations balancing safety and transparency."

557	OODP	Safety Analysis of Bridge Pattern Based on SFTA	In order to analyze the influence of applying design patterns to software safety in software design, this paper carries out a case study on bridge pattern with Software Fault Tree Analysis (SFTA). The result shows that the application of bridge pattern makes the safety reduce by 50%, but the software modules can be decoupled and redundancy design can be added. Introducing double redundancy can improve software safety by two orders of magnitude. The conclusion is valuable for object-oriented design of safety-critical software.

558	OODP	Safety-critical Java programs from Circus models	Safety-Critical Java (SCJ) is a novel version of Java that addresses issues related to real-time programming and certification of safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a technique that reveals the issues involved in the formal verification of an SCJ program, and provides guidelines for tackling them in a refinement-based approach. It is based on Circus, a combination of well established notations: Z, CSP, Timed CSP, and object orientation. We cater for the specification of timing requirements and their decomposition towards the structure of missions and event handlers of SCJ. We also consider the integrated refinement of value-based specifications into class-based designs using SCJ scoped memory areas. We present a refinement strategy, a Circus variant that captures the essence of the SCJ paradigm, and a substantial example based approach on a concurrent version of a case study that has been used as a benchmark by the SCJ community: an aircraft collision detector.

Today, modern object-relational DBMS offer far better capabilities than the systems that have been built in the past based on the strict relational paradigm. Constraint maintenance has been oriented on transformation of structures to structures that are free of functional dependencies beside key constraints.

561	OODP	Seamless integration of rule-based knowledge and object-oriented functionality with linguistic symbiosis	Software applications often contain implicit knowledge in addition to functionality which is inherently object-oriented. Many approaches and systems exist that focus on separating rule-based knowledge from object-oriented functionality and representing it explicitly in a logic reasoning system. Support for seamless integration of this knowledge with the object-oriented functionality improves software development and evolution. Our hypothesis is that a linguistic symbiosis is required between the logic reasoning and object-oriented programming paradigms in order to achieve seamless integration. This paper presents a symbiotic extension of SOUL, a system which implements a logic programming language and a production system in Smalltalk. The presence of these two logic reasoning systems in SOUL ensures a comprehensive coverage of rule-based reasoning styles, more specifically forward and backward chaining. Our approach is evaluated by means of two case studies. We summarise a comprehensive survey, which shows that existing systems do not fully support seamless integration.

562	OODP	Searching design patterns in source code	Maintenance is a time consuming activity within software development and it requires a good understanding of the system in question. It is hard or even impossible to understand poorly documented legacy systems. Nevertheless, developers try to understand unknown object oriented systems by analysing the source code to recover the architecture of the system, which is a hard task since the dependencies between the classes cannot be recovered good enough. Here, the knowledge about design patterns can help developers to understand the underlying architecture faster. We analysed existing pattern search approaches and compared them by their recall and precision values, metrics out of the Information Retrieval domain. As a result we developed own pattern search algorithms for the 23 design pattern described by Gamma et al. [1].

563	OODP	Semantic analysis patterns	The development of object-oriented software starts from requirements expressed commonly as Use Cases. The requirements are then converted into a conceptual or analysis model. Analysis is a fundamental stage because the conceptual model can be shown to satisfy the requirements and becomes the skeleton on which the complete system is built. Most of the use of software patterns until now has been at the design stage and they are applied to provide extensibility and flexibility. However, design patterns don't help avoid analysis errors or make analysis easier. Analysis patterns can contribute more to reusability and software quality than the other varieties. Also, their use contributes to simplifying the development of the analysis model. In particular, a new type of analysis pattern is proposed, called a Semantic Analysis Pattern (SAP), which is in essence a miniapplication, realizing a few Use Cases or a small set of requirements. Using SAPs, a methodology is developed to build the conceptual model in a systematic way.

565	OODP	Semantic refinement of concurrent object systems based on serializability	The focus of our work is the object-oriented design and specification of distributed information systems, applying the technique of stepwise refinement. Following the object-oriented paradigm, static and dynamic system properties have to be taken into account. The aspect of distribution brings in concurrency and communication. In this paper, we formalize a refinement criterion for concurrent object systems which is inspired by the notion of serializable schedules from transaction processing theory. An object-oriented system specification determines the possible behaviour of the intended system. We use labelled event structures to model the concurrent behaviour of systems. For a correct refinement, it is necessary that the abstract behaviour is represented in the refined model. At this point, the idea of serializability comes in. A concurrent abstract system run may be represented in the refined model by a sequential run as long as they have the same input/output behaviour. These refined runs can be characterized as serializable schedules. The work presented is a first step towards bridging the gap between refinement of object-oriented specification concepts and database theory.		Denker, G.

566	OODP	Semantic web service matchmaking based on service behavior	Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is emerging as a new promising computing paradigm. Web service discovery is one of the key issues in SOC. Web service discovery usually provide UDDI as a standard registry which features only keyword-based matches that often give poor performance. Currently approaches for semantic service discovery are mostly limited to the matching of their inputs/outputs possibly enhanced with some ontological knowledge. Recent works have demonstrated that this approach is not sufficient to discover relevant services. In this paper, we argue that in many situations, the service discovery should be based on the specification of service behavior. The idea behind this is to develop matching techniques that operates on behavior models and allow delivery of partial matches.

    abstract = ""Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is emerging as a new promising computing paradigm. Web service discovery is one of the key issues in SOC. Web service discovery usually provide UDDI as a standard registry which features only keyword-based matches that often give poor performance. Currently approaches for semantic service discovery are mostly limited to the matching of their inputs/outputs possibly enhanced with some ontological knowledge. Recent works have demonstrated that this approach is not sufficient to discover relevant services. In this paper, we argue that in many situations, the service discovery should be based on the specification of service behavior. The idea behind this is to develop matching techniques that operates on behavior models and allow delivery of partial matches. We give the relative definition of our formal model based on Petri nets and WF-nets and propose the transformation from the OWL-S process model into a formal model we defined. And then we define behavior equivalence notion based on our formal model and detail the semantic web service matchmaking algorithm based on that notion. (c) 2010 IEEE."",

567	OODP	Semiotics for information systems engineering - re-use of high-level artefacts	The paper examines the nature of requirements engineering in the context of information systems development. The semiotic perspective enables one to recognise the nature and characteristics of the development as a uniform sign-processing (i.e. semiosis) which involves three elements: the object, the sign, and the interpretant. This process reoccurs; at all levels of a systems development project. To improve the quality and productivity of a software project, one can adopt the philosophy of re-use from the object-oriented paradigm. The whole systems development is then viewed as the recursive semiotic transformation from some requirements to a solution. The underlying mechanisms for each transformation are norms which are technical, cultural and social. The proposed semiotic model of information systems development with the help of the theory of norms offers a sound approach toward the re-use of expertise and knowledge of systems development at a higher level. The paper presents a uniform model of semiotic transformation in systems engineering which allows the re-use of high-level artefacts such as experience and processes.

568	OODP	Separation of concerns in compiler development using aspect-orientation	A major difficulty in compiler development regards the proper modularization of concerns among the various compiler phases. The traditional object-oriented development paradigm has difficulty in providing an optimal solution towards modularizing the analysis phases of compiler development, because implementation of each phase often crosscuts the class hierarchy defined by language syntax constructs. Object-oriented design patterns, such as the Visitor pattern, also cannot solve the crosscutting problem adequately because an object is not a natural representation of a collection of operations. This paper demonstrates the benefits of applying aspect-oriented programming languages (e.g., AspectJ) and principles to compiler design and implementation. The experience result shows that the various language constructs in AspectJ (e.g., inter-type declaration, pointcut-advice model, static aspect members and aspect inheritance) fit well with the various computation needs of compiler development, which results in a compiler implementation with improved modularity and better separation of concerns. The ideas utilized in this paper can also be generalized to other software systems with a tree-like structure.

569	OODP	Service-oriented design of metamodel components	Integration of models is an important aspect of Model-Driven Engineering. Current approaches of model integration rely on model weaving and model transformations. In particular, weaving of metamodels allows extending a metamodel with additional concepts, and thereby supporting a larger problem space. Unfortunately, weaving of metamodels is not trivial and requires in-depth knowledge both of the problem domains of the constituent metamodels and the modelling environment. In addition, name conflicts have to be resolved in an intrusive manner. Another disadvantage of many model weaving approaches is that concepts describing different concerns are mixed together without the possibility for semantically tracing the origin of the concepts. In this paper, we propose a new approach for combining metamodels by defining these as reusable services at a conceptual level. We will show that this approach both addresses the issues that arise when models are woven, and illustrate how metamodel components simplify modelling.

As a design pattern allows the instantiation of the best known solution for a given problem, a""spoiled patterndifferent allows the instantiation of alternative solutions for the same problem: requirements are respected, but architecture is improvable. We have collected a set of alternative solutions and deduced the corresponding spoiled patterns. We have defined a first catalog of these improvable practices from several experiments with students. To overcome the limits imposed by this method (restricted public, limited problems and tiresome validation process), we would like to open this problematic to the expert community.

572	OODP	Should decorators preserve the component interface?	Decorator design pattern is a well known pattern that allows dynamical attachment of additional functionality to an object. Decorators have been proposed as flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Still, the Decorator pattern has certain limitations, especially related to the fact that in its classical form it is constrained to a single interface, which is implicitly defined by the type of the concrete components that we intend to decorate. Another problem associated to the Decorator pattern is related to the linear composition of the decorations, which could lead to problems in accessing the newly added responsibilities. In this context, the paper presents variants of the Decorator pattern: MixDecorator and D2Decorator, and a variant specific only to C++ language based on templates b_x0013_ HybridDecorator. MixDecorator could be considered a new enhanced version of the Decorator pattern that eliminates some constraints of the Decorator pattern, but also it could be used as a base of a general extension mechanism. The main advantage of using MixDecorator is that it allows direct access to all newly added responsibilities, and so, we may combine different interface-responsibilities (newly added public methods) and operate with them directly and in any order, hiding the linear composition of the decorations. D2Decorator is a variant based on a double-dispatch mechanism, which is used for connecting the actual decorator that has to receive a certain message call. The C++ metaprogramming mechanism based on templates allows an interesting hybrid variant of the Decorator b_x0013_ HybridDecorator, which mixes on-demand defined inheritance with composition. Using these variants of the Decorator pattern we are not longer limited to one single interface; the set of the messages that could be sent to an object could be enlarged, and so, we may consider that using them, we can dynamically change the type of objects.MSC Codes AMS-Class: D.2.0, D.2.10 Copyright B) 2020, The Authors.

574	OODP	Small world overlay P2P networks	This paper considers the problem of how to construct and maintain an overlay structured P2P network based on the small world paradigm. Two main attractive properties of a small world network are (1) low average hop distance between any two randomly chosen nodes, and (2) high clustering coefficient of nodes. Having a low average hop distance implies a low latency for object lookup, while having a high clustering coefficient implies the underlying network can effectively provide object lookup even under heavy demands (for example, in a flash crowd scenario). We present a small world overlay protocol (SWOP) for constructing a small world overlay P2P network. We compare the performance of our system with that of other structured P2P networks such as Chord. We show that the SWOP protocol can achieve improved object lookup performance over the existing protocols. We also exploit the high clustering coefficient of a SWOP network to design an object replication algorithm that can effectively handle heavy object lookup traffic. As a result, a SWOP network can quickly and efficiently deliver popular and dynamic objects to a large number of requesting nodes. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first piece of work that addresses how to handle dynamic flash crowds in a structured P2P network environment.

575	OODP	Smalltalking to a relational database	The equipment that Honeywell sells to provide process control in factories, refineries, and other such places is diverse and complex. There are several hundred components, each with its own specialized function. Each component has its own unique set of rules and constraints as to how it can be configured, and when the components are combined there are thousands of combinations and permutations of these rules and constraints. As the complexity of the systems has grown over the years, it has become increasingly necessary to have a program that automates the configuration of these systems. The TotalPlant Configurator is Honeywell's most recent version of such a program. The purpose of the TotalPlant Configurator is to take as input a customer's needs and provide as output the Bill of Materials for a configuration of equipment that will satisfy those needs. The designers of the TotalPlant Configurator chose to implement it using the object oriented programming paradigm because it was such a good match for the problem. Each possible component of the configurations could be an object; constraints could be imposed on these objects with methods; and the interaction of the objects, each following its own constraints and rules, would yield a system that would as a whole follow the rules. Objects in the TotalPlant Configurator may be accessed by means of special objects known as keys. These, at the most basic level, can be made to correspond directly to key fields in a relational database.		Andersen, B. (1); Miller, B. (1); Pitts, D. (1); Johnson, J.

577	OODP	Smart active object: a new object-oriented programming paradigm for developing multithreaded applications	Multithreaded programming has been widely used nowadays, but developing multithreaded applications is still a tough task. To alleviate such kind of work we propose a new concept, smart active object, an extension to the normal object in object-oriented technology. Smart active object runs concurrently with the main execution logic of the program, leveraging multithreading mechanisms and meanwhile leaves only sequential interfaces for programmers to insert application-specific parts, masking details of multithreading, which eventually enhances programming productivity. To support our claims, we design and implement a framework comprising a collection of cooperative smart active objects for stateful applications, a typical problem in telecom world. Using this framework, we easily solve a toy problem, derived from the behavior of SIP stateful proxy servers within much shorter time than a conventional C version counterpart.

578	OODP	Smartmodels b_x0013_ A framework for generating on-line sales management systems	Shopping online has set a strong mark on the marketplace today and on the way the new generation of youth and couples resource. Every supplier has to go online to market its offers for a wider customer community in order to stay on top. One of the prime-time opportunities is to build web-based software solutions in order to support online sales. But there are so many types of products and patterns of marketing when thinking how to generate the content of a web page. GeoInformatics play a major role. Moreover, there are security concerns and all the operations that need management after the sales that the complexity of such a software system can be hard to implement and it can hardly foresee all future forms of such a business model. This is one of the main concerns of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles which did not cure important issues faced by software companies these days on developing complex software for reuse and protecting the more and more evolving applications against technological obsolescence. The Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) project from OMG promotes the use of metamodeling in order to drive the systemb_x0019_s design and implementation. In this context this paper presents: - an approach: it reviews the SmartModels approach briefly introducing its principles, basic entities and main elements when defining a business-model; - a prototype: SmartFactory which is based on Eclipse platform and its role is to validate the new approach. It addresses the paradigm of how to practically implement MDA principles and rules for software engineering. Therefore, it deals with important implementation issues based on Eclipse Platform. In the world of software everything evolves: technologies, methodologies and applications. I believe that in order to provide an approach centered on models, which capture the know-how of a domain, it is of primary importance to ensure the independence between both the model and the software platform and between the model and the possible applications.

579	OODP	SOA practices and patterns applied in global software development	Prior research has established a relationship between coordination of software development activities and software architecture both in collocated and distributed projects. Despite the recognized importance of the software architecture in the coordination of development activities, it is still unclear how software architects design the architecture of software systems in distributed projects. To better understand this scenario, this paper reports from a qualitative empirical study where we interviewed software architects to collect information about the software architecture of distributed projects. Information collected has exposed the wide adoption of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), indicating a trend towards the usage of this low coupling architectural style by companies developing projects with distributed teams. More detailed data collected by follow-up interviews suggested a set of best practices for designing SOA architectures to facilitate the work of the project members.

580	OODP	SOA-GovMM: A meta model for a comprehensive SOA governance repository	In recent years, the paradigm of service-oriented architecture (SOA) has more and more found its way into many organizations. The SOA principles of loosely coupled and reusable services has convinced decision makers in many organizations to start SOA initiatives. Yet, the lack of proper governance mechanisms has doomed many projects to fail. Although some SOA governance frameworks exist, they differ highly in scope and none of them covers the whole spectrum necessary to properly govern a SOA. In this paper we identify and discuss eleven core areas the governance of a SOA has to cover in order to realize the intended benefit in flexibility and agility. We then analyze and evaluate existing SOA governance frameworks with regard to those requirements. Subsequently, we present a meta model composed of four parts: Service Provider, Service Consumer, Organizational Structure and Business Object. We show, that those four parts cover all requirements for a comprehensive SOA governance repository. This allows an organization to leverage the information integrated in the repository to better govern their SOA and therefore improve the chances of its success.

581	OODP	Societal computing	Social Computing research focuses on online social behavior and using artifacts derived from it for providing recommendations and other useful community knowledge. Unfortunately, some of that behavior and knowledge incur societal costs, particularly with regards to Privacy, which is viewed quite differently by different populations as well as regulated differently in different locales. But clever technical solutions to those challenges may impose additional societal costs, e.g., by consuming substantial resources at odds with Green Computing, another major area of societal concern. We propose a new crosscutting research area, Societal Computing, that focuses on the technical tradeoffs among computational models and application domains that raise significant societal issues. This dissertation, advised by Prof. Gail Kaiser, will focus on privacy concerns in the context of Societal Computing and will aim to address research topics such as design patterns and architectures for privacy tradeoffs, better understanding of users' privacy requirements so that tradeoffs with other areas such as green computing can be dealt with in a more effective manner, and better visualization techniques for making privacy and its tradeoffs more understandable.

582	OODP	SoCoEMo-COTS: a software economic model for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) based software development	With component-based reuse, software development is achieved through the planned integration of pre-existing software components. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) based development (CBD) is one of the systematic reuse approaches promising gains in cost, operational quality, functionality, time to market and maintenance overheads. This is an increasingly popular paradigm for software development, but one that is not without risks and associated costs. In fact, an increasing number and variety of COTS components become available but it is important to understand the costs, benefits, and risks entailed in using these components. This paper presents an economic model for any organization willing to adopt a CBD approach for its systems development. Such model which quantifies the predicted benefits and return on investment of CBD can help managers make the good decision to adopt or not such a reuse approach. We denote our model SoCoEMo-COTS for 'Software Cost Estimation Model for COTS'.		Lamine, S.B.A.B. (1); Jilani, L.L. (1); Ghezala, H.H.B.

The properties of service-oriented software systems are substantially enhanced if the service interfaces can be user and business oriented. It has consequences for the use of standards. We show the ways of the flexible implementation of user-oriented interfaces for existing applications. The implementation uses specific infrastructure services. The concept of infrastructure services can be used for portals and for flexible business process control services. We show that several known object-oriented antipatterns are in fact leading patterns in service orientation. Many issues in service-oriented development are caused by the fact that service orientation is for many developers and users a new paradigm requiring new attitudes and solutions for both developers and users. Some typical reasons of the issues are discussed in details.

Functional paradigm seems to be a platform that can support code reuse better than object-oriented or procedural programming paradigms. This work focuses on identifying potentially reusable components in functional programming paradigm. To conduct the experiments, various software metrics of software components written in Haskell have been used. In this research work, the Self-Organizing Map algorithm is used to cluster the functions from three Haskell packages into three different classes of reusability. Clustering of functions is based on metrics threshold and their average values.

585	OODP	Software Design Patterns for Information Visualization	Despite a diversity of software architectures supporting information visualization, it is often difficult to identify, evaluate, and re-apply the design solutions implemented within such frameworks. One popular and effective approach for addressing such difficulties is to capture successful solutions in design patterns, abstract descriptions of interacting software components that can be customized to solve design problems within a particular context. Based upon a review of existing frameworks and our own experiences building visualization software, we present a series of design patterns for the domain of information visualization. We discuss the structure, context of use, and interrelations of patterns spanning data representation, graphics, and interaction. By representing design knowledge in a reusable form, these patterns can be used to facilitate software design, implementation, and evaluation, and improve developer education and communication	Software design; Data visualization; Software architecture; Buildings; Context; Software engineering; Programming profession; Computer languages; Application software; Graphics; Visual Information; Design Patterns; Software Design Patterns; Context Of Use; Design Solutions; Interactive; Data Model; Data Visualization; Field Data; Structural Patterns; Human-computer Interaction; Reference Model; Expressive Language; Changes In Appearance; Row Of Table; Visual Model; Visual Properties; Unified Modeling Language; Simple Objects; Visual Framework; Visual Items; Product Rule; Relation Graph; Visual Encoding; Direct Use; Set Of Rules; Design patterns; information visualization; software engineering; object-oriented programming; Algorithms; Computer Graphics; Database Management Systems; Databases, Factual; Information Storage and Retrieval; Software; Software Design; User-Computer Interface	Jeffrey Heer; Maneesh Agrawala	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.178	"1.S.

586	OODP	Software development environment for the object-oriented nonstop service enhanceable software (NOSES) platform	This paper presents key technologies for a software development environment that supports software reuse and efficient file making. An efficient software development framework is proposed to develop the nonstop service enhanceable software (NOSES) platform. To enhance software reusability, this platform is constructed so that it can be applied to many kinds of communication switching systems, such as telephony, ISDN, ATM and IN. Software components within this platform can easily be reused, because they are based on the C++ object-oriented paradigm. Several methods are proposed for reducing file making turn-around time. These methods, which are particular types of partial program replacement techniques, are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. These analyses show the effectiveness of this platform and software development environment.

588	OODP	Software reusability metrics estimation from the social media by using evolutionary algorithms: Refactoring prospective	Software expansion is rising with the help of the standard paradigm in the 21st century. The maximum contribution of software growth focuses mainly on object-oriented development methodologies. This paradigm helps the developer to develop code quickly and makes sure that the platform assists in producing a quality product. The software reusability metrics play a crucial role for software development. To overcome the scalability issues, researchers and developers both adopt a CK metrics suite to extract the software metrics to extract the features from the repositories.

590	OODP	Software reuse in practice: The role of object technology	More and more companies are requiring that new information systems development projects employ object oriented (OO) analysis, design and programming approaches. Much of the movement toward this paradigm for systems development is based on claims of vendors and pioneers in the technique for better designs, more maintainable systems, and most audibly, reusable software. While focusing on the synergies expected from the reuse of objects, this study also examines other aspects of OO and reuse as they independently inform today's software practices.

591	OODP	Software streamlining: Reducing software to essentials	Software products tend to become more sophisticated as they are actively maintained and used. While new software sophistication provides updated functionality, an undesired result of the expansion is the arrival of complicatedness. One obvious consequence of the new complicacy is an opportunity for new bugs. However, another often overlooked result is the increased difficulty of use and the greater demand for operational resources. It is also apparent that not all applications require all the features provided by software systems, and in many cases, only a small subset of features is ever used. With this in mind, this paper presents a development paradigm of taking an existing software product and streamlining it into a smaller and less complicated version, which provides only a useful subset of essential functionalities. To demonstrate this new workflow feasibility, the existing aerospace operating system RODOS is adapted it to a smaller and less complicated version. The results show it is possible to make software less complicated, easier to use, and improve resource economy.

592	OODP	Modeling statecharts and activitycharts as signal equations	The languages for modeling reactive systems are of different styles, like the imperative, state-based ones and the declarative, data-flow ones. They are adapted to different application domains. This paper, through the example of the languages Statecharts and Signal, shows a way to give a model of an imperative specification (Statecharts) in a declarative, equational one (Signal). This model constitutes a formal model of the Statemate semantics of Statecharts, upon which formal analysis techniques can be applied. Being a transformation from an imperative to a declarative structure, it involves the definition of generic models for the explicit management of state (in the case of control as well as of data). In order to obtain a structural construction of the model, a hierarchical and modular organization is proposed, including proper management and propagation of control along the hierarchy. The results presented here cover the essential features of Statecharts as well as of another language of Statemate: Activitycharts. As a translation, it makes multiformalism specification possible, and provides support for the integrated operation of the languages. The motivation lies also in the perspective of gaining access to the various formal analysis and implementation tools of the synchronous technology, using the DC1 exchange format, as in the Sacres programming environment.	behavioral modeling;  ctatemate;  reactive systems;  signal;  synchronous languages;  tatecharts; behavioral modeling, ctatemate, reactive systems, signal, synchronous languages, tatecharts	Beauvais, J.-R.; Rutten, E.; Gautier, T.; Houdebine, R.; Le.

594	OODP	SoSPa: A system of Security design Patterns for systematically engineering secure systems	Model-Driven Security (MDS) for secure systems development still has limitations to be more applicable in practice. A recent systematic review of MDS shows that current MDS approaches have not dealt with multiple security concerns systematically. Besides, catalogs of security patterns which can address multiple security concerns have not been applied efficiently. This paper presents an MDS approach based on a unified System of Security design Patterns (SoSPa). In SoSPa, security design patterns are collected, specified as reusable aspect models to form a coherent system of them that guides developers in systematically addressing multiple security concerns. SoSPa consists of not only interrelated security design patterns but also a refinement process towards their application. We applied SoSPa to design the security of crisis management systems. The result shows that multiple security concerns in the case study have been addressed by systematically integrating different security solutions.

596	OODP	Specifying and verifying advanced control features	Advances in programming often revolve around key design patterns, which programming languages embody as new control features. These control features, such as higher-order functions, advice, and context dependence, use indirection to decrease coupling and enhance modularity. However, this indirection makes them difficult to verify, because it hides actions (and their effects) behind an abstraction barrier. Such abstraction barriers can be overcome in a modular way using greybox specification techniques, provided the programming language supports interfaces as a place to record specifications. These techniques have previously allowed specification and modular verification of higher-order functional and object-oriented programs, as well as aspect-oriented and context-oriented programs.

597	OODP	Stable aspects in robot software development	"The paper investigates the concept of software ""stability"" applied to robot systems. We define ""stable"" a family of systems modelled, designed and implemented so that specific applications of the family may be developed re-using, adapting and specializing knowledge, architecture and existing components. During the last few years, many ideas and technologies of software engineering (e.g. modularity, OO development and design patterns) were introduced in the development of robotic systems to improve the ""stability"" property. All these ideas and technologies are important. Nevertheless, they model robotic systems along a unique direction: the functional decomposition of parts. Unfortunately, there are concerns of robotic systems that relate to the systems as a whole hence crosscutting their modular structure. The Aspect Oriented Software Development is a recently emerged approach for modelling, designing and encapsulating the above-mentioned crosscutting concerns (aspects). We contend that stability must be based on a careful domain analysis and on a multidimensional modelling of different and recurring aspects of robot systems."

599	OODP	Strategy Pattern as a Variability Enabling Mechanism in Product Line Architecture	Business applications that share a common architecture and a set of reusable components, implemented by the Software Product Line (SPL) approach to software reuse, can benefit from handling the variability with extensive use of architectural design patterns. Use of the patterns within the Product Line Architecture (PLA) frameworks, yields a number of benefits toward the improvement of maintainability of the applications which are part of a SPL family.

601	OODP	Systematic derivation of class diagrams from communication-oriented business process models	Enterprise information systems can be developed following a model-driven paradigm. This way, models that represent the organisational work practice are used to produce models that represent the information system. Current software development methods are starting to provide guidelines for the construction of conceptual models, taking as input requirements models. This paper proposes the integration of two methods: Communication Analysis (a communication-oriented requirements engineering method [1]) and the OO Method (a model-driven object-oriented software development method [2]). For this purpose, a systematic technique for deriving class diagrams from business process models is proposed. The business process specifications (which include message structures) are processed in order to obtain class diagram views, which are integrated to create the class diagram incrementally. Then, using the olivanova framework, software source code can be generated automatically. The paper also discusses the advantages and current limitations of the technique. Results show that, although there is room for improvement, the technique is feasible and it does facilitate the creation of the class diagram.

603	OODP	Technical requirements for the implementation of an experience base	Reuse of different types of experience is a key issue in successful improvement in software engineering. The approach taken in the quality improvement paradigm (QIP) and its supporting organisation, the experience factory (EF), is to define an experience base (EB), where all types of reusable objects are organised and stored. The objects may be of any type related to software development, for example code, quality models and specifications. Furthermore, not only objects identical to the target object needed can be reused, but also similar ones. This paper defines important concepts in a reuse context, elaborates a reuse scenario from which the requirements for the implementation of an experience base are derived. A list of 22 technical requirements are defined which cover the functional aspects related to the use of an experience base. The evaluation of three alternative implementation approaches are presented, two database alternatives and one based on case-based reasoning (CBR). It is concluded that no implementation fulfils all the requirements. Future work is to investigate the costs for extending the functionality to fulfil the requirements.		Broome, M. (1); Runeson, P.

604	OODP	Telescope: an object-oriented architecture for visualization systems	The construction of information visualization systems is a difficult task. The provision of an object-oriented software architecture for this kind of system can help to reduce this difficulty. However, this approach is not currently used in most visualization systems. In this paper, Telescope, an object-oriented architecture for visualization systems, is presented. Its main goal is to facilitate this construction, taking advantage of the benefits of the object-oriented paradigm (reusability, extensibility and maintainability). The Telescope architecture is based on six main components, which are common to all information visualization systems: data representation, data abstraction, data object-graphical object mapping, data presentation, interaction and visualization state. CityVis, a visualization system for city data developed using the Telescope architecture, is described, showing the implementation of each Telescope component. Also, the implementation of several features in visualization systems, such as visualization techniques and the management of abstraction levels and revealed information is described. Finally, current work and conclusions of the project are explained.		Orosco, R.

605	OODP	Temperature and moisture evolution beneath an aerogel based rendering applied to a historic building	Retrofitting of buildings defined as cultural heritage with respect to energy consumption and thermal comfort of the occupants is a demanding endeavor due to the additional requirements of the conservation aspect. Within a pilot project an inhabited mill in Sissach/Switzerland whose first mention dates back to the 14th century has been retrofitted by using a highly insulating external rendering containing SiO2 aerogel and mainly mineral admixtures namely hydraulic lime, calcium hydroxide, white cement, aerogel granules, light mineral aggregate, water retaining agent, air-entraining agent, except the organic hydrophobic agent. By a rendering thickness of 5-6 cm, the thermal transmittance through the walls was reduced to one third of its original value and the thermal comfort in the 6 apartments improved substantially including a reduction in mold growth risk. The characteristics of the aerogel based rendering have been discussed especially with respect to preservation aspects. By installing temperature and moisture sensors on the original wall and beneath the insulating rendering it was shown that its application on the original walls fulfils the requirement for avoiding moisture accumulation. Further, hygro-thermic simulations were performed extrapolating temperature evolution and water content for a period of 5 years. The object represents a new paradigm in the energy efficient restoration of the built heritage and simultaneously respecting the conservation aspects. The project has been carefully monitored by the state office (Basel-Landschaft) for preservation of monuments.

606	OODP	Term rewriting meets aspect-oriented programming	We explore the connection between term rewriting systems (TRS) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP). Term rewriting is a paradigm that is used in fields such as program transformation and theorem proving. AOP is a method for decomposing software, complementary to the usual separation into programs, classes, functions, etc. An aspect represents code that is scattered across the components of an otherwise orderly decomposed system. Using AOP, such code can be modularized into aspects and then automatically weaved into a system. Aspect weavers are available for only a handful of languages. Term rewriting can offer a method for the rapid prototyping of weavers for more languages. We explore this claim by presenting a simple weaver implemented as a TRS. We also observe that TRS can benefit from AOP. For example, their flexibility can be enhanced by factoring out hardwired code for tracing and logging rewrite rules. We explore methods for enhancing TRS with aspects and present one application: automatically connecting an interactive debugger to a language specification.

607	OODP	The 4-Tier design pattern for the development of an android application	Recently, increasing in demand for smart phone and related applications has changed people's life style rapidly. In particular, Apple's IPhone and Google's Android phone has been increased in demand, and the application development of those has become the necessary elements in the business area. But because the application of the smart phone has made in the special framework environment and the design of the application has made base on the user interface with domain area, the application complexity increases. For reduce the complexity, we propose the 4-Tire design pattern for the android application.

609	OODP	The complexity of object-oriented logic programming	LCPP is a multi-paradigm programming language. It is the combination of logic and object-oriented programming, and is developed by the author. Because it is based on object-orientation, and the logic paradigm is achieved by extending object methods, logic programming thus has inherited the properties of object inheritance and polymorphism and dynamic binding. Combined with the logic search in object sets, the complexity of logic search has been greatly enhanced. In this paper, the above issues and their resolving approaches are discussed.

610	OODP	The control-command environment of the Virgo experiment	The Virgo experiment is a challenge in many aspects, particularly for the control-command environment. The essential requirements for flexibility and reliability, induced by the veiy drastic technical constraints as well as the unapprehended nature of the overall logic imply that strong and well-defined paradigms are used throughout the building phases of this environment. This results in providing a software architecture, called the Supervisor environment based upon some basic principles such as the component oriented packaging or the use of scriptable formal languages. In addition, keeping this architecture simple and well defined makes it compliant with quality requirements for long term maintenance, evolution and interoperability. This environment provides the basic services required by user applications to operate the experiment such as communication, database management, error handling, logic and graphical control as a set of interoperable components making extensive use of the object oriented paradigm and of the scriptable specification languages. The Supervisor itself is the basic control application and can be cloned, refined and customized to extend the basic logic towards specific needs. The presentation will show some of the basic ingredients of this architecture, and will discuss how user control applications have been integrated in this environment.

613	OODP	The design and implementation of a customizable fault tolerance framework	While there have been significant advances in fault tolerance research, the effort has focused on the design of individual fault-tolerant systems or methodologies. Recently, some research has been initiated to develop techniques that can provide a spectrum of fault tolerance capabilities. In this paper, we present the design of a fault tolerance framework that can support a wide range of applications with various fault tolerance requirements, various criticality levels, and various system models. The framework is designed to be parameterizable so that the user can configure it to obtain the desired features. Also, the framework is designed to be an off-the-shelf component such that application programs can be integrated within it easily to obtain the fault-tolerant version of the application system. A specialized N-modular redundancy (SNMR) scheme has been developed to serve as the primary approach for achieving efficient and cost-effective fault tolerance for the framework. In most cases, the SNMR scheme yields better performance and lower cost in providing fault tolerance as compared with conventional NMR schemes. It also enhances the scalability and customizability of the general replication method.

615	OODP	The disadvantages of object technology	The real advantage of using object technology is not re-use, but the imposition of discipline and structured methods. In this article, I look at some of the disadvantages of the technology that is being used to support objects-disadvantages that may actually negate the benefits of objects in the long term. At their very simplest, objects or components are blocks of code (in any language) accessed by a defined interface (or interfaces in the case of Microsoft's components). The interface names the object itself and defines the methods which can be invoked, along with the parameters of those methods. An object shares a lot of similarities with RPCs (remote procedure calls). The difference is that RPCs only involve one function, whereas objects group functions. Both are, however, defined by an interface definition language (IDL) and rely on request/reply synchronous communication as the main programming paradigm. Where RPCs are looked on as being a bit old-fashioned, however, objects are, of course, very fashionable. At first sight, objects should be as simple to program as RPCs, but over time, the technology appears to have taken over and several problems have emerged.		Rock-Evans, R.

617	OODP	The end of the age of miracles? [Software development]	The most common miracles of software engineering are the transitions from analysis to design and from design to code. The impediments to this transformation are almost insurmountable. The world view, the way of thinking, the experience and vocabulary of the people involved with the current application domain are completely different from the experience, vocabulary, interests and requirements of the systems designer. I have been working with a new architectural approach whose purpose is to isolate and insulate clients, analysts and programmers while still developing effective, robust and integrated systems. This new approach incorporates the object approach and object design patterns in a novel and productive way. Will this approach truly bring the end of an age of miracles? It at least allows us to try to develop systems that do not require miracles to implement. A second benefit of the approach is that it will allow analysis models to be independent of implementation technology. New developments in persistence, distribution and operating systems can be isolated into proxy classes. The proxy classes can be enhanced in a way that is transparent to the clients and the clients' analysis class models. Not only can systems be developed without miracles, they can be maintained and enhanced without miracles as well!		Due, R.T. (1)	American Programmer			33-6							2					Cutter Inf.

618	OODP	The expression problem, trivially!	This paper presents a novel and simple solution to Wadler's Expression Problem that works in conventional objectoriented languages. Unlike all existing solutions in Java-like languages, this new solution does not use any kind of generics: it relies only on subtyping. The key to the solution is the use of covariant type refinement of return types (or fields): A simple feature available in many object-oriented languages, but not as widely known or used as it should be. We believe that our results present valuable insights for researchers and programming language designers interested in extensibility. Furthermore our results have immediate applicability as practical design patterns for improving the extensibility of programs.

620	OODP	The impact of flyweight and proxy design patterns on software efficiency: An empirical evaluation	In this era of technology, delivering quality software has become a crucial requirement for the developers. Quality software is able to help an organization to success and gain a competitive edge in the market. There are numerous quality attributes introduced by various quality models. Various researches and studies prove that the quality of the object-oriented software can be improved by using design patterns. The main purpose of this research is to identify the relationships between the design patterns and software efficiency quality attribute. This research is focused on the impact of Flyweight and Proxy Design Patterns on the efficiency of software. An example scenario is used to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of applied design refinements on efficiency of a system. The techniques to measure software efficiency and the results obtained for each solution are elaborated in detail. At the end of this research, comparative analysis is provided to show the relative impact of each selected design pattern on software efficiency.

621	OODP	The information funnel: Exploiting named data for information-maximizing data collection	This paper describes the exploitation of hierarchical data names to achieve information-utility maximizing data collection in social sensing applications. We describe a novel transport abstraction, called the information funnel. It encapsulates a data collection protocol for social sensing that maximizes a measure of delivered information utility, that is the minimized data redundancy, by diversifying the data objects to be collected. The abstraction leverages named-data networking, a communication paradigm where data objects are named instead of hosts. We argue that this paradigm is especially suited for utility-maximizing transport in resource constrained environments, because hierarchical data names give rise to a notion of distance between named objects that is a function of only the topology of the name tree. This distance, in turn, can expose similarities between named objects that can be leveraged for minimizing redundancy among objects transmitted over bottlenecks, thereby maximizing their aggregate utility. With a proper hierarchical name space design, our protocol prioritizes transmission of data objects over bottlenecks to maximize information utility, with very weak assumptions on the utility function. This prioritization is achieved merely by comparing data name prefixes, without knowing application-level name semantics, which makes it generalizable across a wide range of applications. Evaluation results show that the information funnel improves the utility of the collected data objects compared to other lossy protocols.

622	OODP	The interpretation and utility of three cohesion metrics for object-oriented design	The concept of cohesion in a class has been the subject of various recent empirical studies and has been measured using many different metrics. In the structured programming paradigm, the software engineering community has adopted an informal yet meaningful and understandable definition of cohesion based on the work of Yourdon and Constantine. The object-oriented (OO) paradigm has formalised various cohesion measures, but the argument over the most meaningful of those metrics continues to be debated. Yet achieving highly cohesive software is fundamental to its comprehension and thus its maintainability. In this article we subject two object-oriented cohesion metrics, CAMC and NHD, to a rigorous mathematical analysis in order to better understand and interpret them. This analysis enables us to offer substantial arguments for preferring the NHD metric to CAMC as a measure of cohesion. Furthermore, we provide a complete understanding of the behaviour of these metrics, enabling us to attach a meaning to the values calculated by the CAMC and NHD metrics. In addition, we introduce a variant of the NHD metric and demonstrate that it has several advantages over CAMC and NHD. While it may be true that a generally accepted formal and informal definition of cohesion continues to elude the OO software engineering community, there seems considerable value in being able to compare, contrast, and interpret metrics which attempt to measure the same features of software.

623	OODP	The kuroko paradigm: The implications of augmenting physical interaction with AR avatars	We propose a concept in this poster paper, the Kuroko Paradigm, which is able to enhance user engagement during interaction with an augmented reality (AR) avatar by adding a physical object to the interaction with the avatar. With the development of AR and VR, interactions between users and AR avatars have been realized with different approaches. However, most of such interactions and experiences are passive, from which users do not expect a high level of engagement. We hypothesize that by introducing a reality actuator, such as a robot or a drone, to handle a physical object triggered by the user without being noticed, and rendering AR avatars as interacting with the physical object at the same time, user engagement during the experience will be enhanced. To prove this concept, we conducted an experiment emulating a classic game of catch. In the experiment, a user will try to throw a ball to an AR avatar, and the ball will be caught by a reality actuator. From the user's perspective, the ball is caught by the AR avatar. In the future, we plan to extend the experiment by adding control groups with differing conditions.

625	OODP	The non-blocking programming paradigm in large scale scientific computations	Non-blocking implementation of shared data objects is a new alternative approach to the problem of designing scalable shared data objects for multiprocessor systems. Non-blocking implementations allow multiple tasks to access a shared object at the same time, but without enforcing mutual exclusion to accomplish this. Since, in non-blocking implementations of shared data objects, one process is not allowed to block another process, non-blocking shared data objects have the following significant advantages over lock-based ones: 1) they avoid lock convoys and contention points (locks). 2) they provide high fault tolerance (processor failures will never corrupt shared data objects) and eliminates deadlock scenarios, where two or more tasks are waiting for locks held by the other. 3) they do not give priority inversion scenarios. As shown in [1, 2], non-blocking synchronisation has better performance in certain application than blocking synchronisation. In this paper, we try to provide an in depth understanding of the performance benefits of integrating non-blocking synchronisation in scientific computing applications.

626	OODP	The object oriented model and its advantages	This paper examines some advantages of the Object Oriented Model (O.O.M), such as reuse of code. better structured programs and easier transition from analysis to implementation. It presents some examples, showing why the O.O.M results in higher code reuse than procedural programming. The paper points also the advantages of Object Oriented Analysis (O.O.A) and of Data Abstraction (even though no direct connection exists between D.A. and the O.O.M).The reader is supposed to have some knowledge of the Object Oriented paradigm (class definition, objects. inheritance and polymorphism) and of C++ language.

627	OODP	The object-oriented design knowledge ontology	It has been a long time since the object-oriented (OO) paradigm appeared. From that moment, designers have accumulated much knowledge in design and construction of OO systems. Patterns are the most refined OO design knowledge. However, there are many others kinds of knowledge than are not yet classified and formalized. Therefore, we feel it necessary to define ontology in order to structure and unify such knowledge; a good understanding of practical experience is crucial to software engineers. Therefore, this chapter proposes an ontology for object-oriented design knowledge. B) 2007, Idea Group Inc.

630	OODP	The role of attention in processing configural and shape information in 3-D novel objects	Recent research suggests that there is an advantage for processing configural information in scenes and objects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which attention may account for this configural advantage. In Experiment 1, we found that cueing the location of change in single object displays improved detection performance for both configural and shape changes, yet cueing attention away from the location of change was detrimental only for shape change detection. A configural advantage was present for each cueing condition. Experiments 2A and 2B examined whether the configural advantage persisted in conditions where attention was distributed more widely, using a visual search paradigm. Although searches for configural changes were faster than those for shape changes across all set sizes, both types of information appeared to be processed with similar efficiency. Overall, these results suggest that the configural advantage is independent of the location or distribution of visual attention.	accuracy; article; association; attention; color vision; distractibility; human; human experiment; mental performance; normal human; pattern recognition; priority journal; reaction time; validity; visual discrimination; visual field; visual information; visual orientation; visual stimulation; accuracy;  article;  association;  attention;  color vision;  distractibility;  human;  human experiment;  mental performance;  normal human;  pattern recognition;  priority journal;  reaction time;  validity;  visual discrimination;  visual field;  visual information;  visual orientation;  visual stimulation	Favelle, Simone; Palmisano, Stephen; Burke, Darren; Hayward, William G.

It is the result of an international effort involving industry and academia. What we provide here is, as far as we know, the first formalisation of the SCJ model of memory regions. We use the Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) to enable the integration of our theory with refinement models for object-orientation and concurrency. In developing the SCJ theory, we also make a contribution to the UTP by providing a general theory of invariants (of which the SCJ theory is an instance). Our results are a first essential ingredient to formalise the novel programming paradigm embedded in SCJ, and enable the justification and development of reasoning techniques based on refinement.

633	OODP	The Strengthening Legal Protection of Indigenous People in Facing Investment Climate in Era of Asean Economic Community in	Indigenous people, along with their traditional rights including communal rights, are recognized and sheltered under article 18B section (2) and article 28I section (3) of 1945 Constitution, Forestry Act, and regional regulation. However, the arrangement still remains sectoral and inconsistent, which does not fully stand for the Indigenous people. This contradiction was revealed in the Decision of the Constitutional Court Number 35/PUU-X/2012 on customary forest position provisions in the Forestry Act that was confirmed contradictory to the 1945 Constitution. This juridical fact becomes a foundation for State to provide communal indigenous people's land for investing in natural resources. The used paradigm fact is positioning indigenous people and communal rights, including local wisdom, as the object of development. Consequently, several problems occurred, including: environmental degradation, inequality of structural control, ownership, utilization of land, declining of indigenous people's welfare, and the emergence of conflicts; thus, posing a threat for national stability, security, and integrity. The enforcement of ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) will make investment climate more open to increase development which correlates to the improvement of people's welfare, including indigenous people. The recommendations are: 1) Ratification of indigenous people's draft act which expressly and consistently acknowledges and respects the indigenous people and their traditional rights; 2) Obligating local governments to establish local regulations on the treatment of indigenous people and their traditional rights including customary land rights; 3) Identifying, mapping, and establishing customary land rights as indigenous people's rights and issuing certificates of ownership; 4) Mediating partnership between indigenous people's land owner and investor; and 5) Placing indigenous people as the subject of development by implementing free prior informed consent, regulating it in nomenclature constitution, while engaging and enhancing the role of government as mediator and facilitator between indigenous people and investor.

634	OODP	The study of SOA/CBD-based next-generation business system platform design	In the early stage, we had to design e-Business service system the way that makes process as to classify functions on the basis of functionality. However, as becoming expanding service and complicating functionality, design pattern has been changed into service point of view not function point of view. Also, technology trend became advanced with focus of service-oriented. Then SOA, the new technical concept, has been introduced and applied to eBusiness system design. That is, it means it will be progressed with service-oriented top-down way not function-oriented top-down way when service system is defined. Therefore, this paper proposes the next- generation e-Business service platform that applies to SOA concept and is designed with CBD method. It firstly analyzes functions operating at legacy ebusiness service systems and redefines those functions with service point of view. And it groups into components unit and it reuse legacy application resources. To do this, it will be able to upgrade eBusiness service system and to increase efficiency of resources as reusing legacy resources. Also, it is easy to migrate new service to e-Business system because of service engine. And legacy system's modification will be minimized because of reusing the legacy modules and providing interface adaptor.

The process to conduct such evaluations is crucial to get evaluation results that can be applied and meet customers' expectations. This paper reviews a well-known evaluation process: the ISO 14598 standard. The review focuses on the difficulties in selecting and evaluating the appropriate evaluation techniques. The review shows that the standard has problems in applying evaluation processes in practice due to insufficient attention to goal definition and to relationships between activities being implicit. Also, the standard ignores the trade-off between goals and resources and pays insufficient attention to feedback. To address these deficiencies, the W-process is proposed.

636	OODP	Theoretical principles for knowledge management system design: Application to pediatric bipolar disorder	"Knowledge management systems (KMS) are systems designed to support organizational knowledge processes. Knowledge-oriented theories of the firm are emerging, as theories of KMS design continue to evolve. This paper adopts Habermas' theory of communicative action and discourse ethics [Drake, B, Yuthas, K, and Dillard, J F., ""It's Only Words - Impacts on Information Technology on Moral Dialogue"", Journal of Business Ethics 23: 41-59, 2000, Habermas, J., The Theory of Communicative Action: Reason and the Rationalization of Society,"" Beacon Press Books, Boston, MA., 1984, Habermas, J., ""Reconciliation through the Public Use of Reason: Remarks on John Rawls's Political Liberalism,"" Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 92, No. 3, March, 1995, 1109-131.], and Churchman's [Churchman, C.W., The Design of Inquiring Systems: Basic Concepts of Systems and Organizations, Basic Books, New York, NY, 1971.] Singerian inquiring system as kernel theories [Van Gigch, J.P., ""The Paradigm of the Science of Management: In Celebration of C.W. Churchman's 80th Birthday,"" Interfaces, 25 (2), March - April 1995, 81-88.] on which to base KMS design principles. Specifically, we build on Churchman's nine requirements for an object to constitute a system and his Singerian inquiring system, and Habermas' critical theory to develop the notion of Churchmanian-Habermasian knowledge management systems (CHKMS) and principles for their design. We define a CHKMS as a purposeful, ethical and adaptable system that creates exoteric knowledge (relevant for solving social and managerial problems) through communicative action, providing a link between knowledge and action in an organization or community of practice.

Churchman's 80th Birthday,"" Interfaces, 25 (2), March - April 1995, 81-88.] on which to base KMS design principles. Specifically, we build on Churchman's nine requirements for an object to constitute a system and his Singerian inquiring system, and Habermas' critical theory to develop the notion of Churchmanian-Habermasian knowledge management systems (CHKMS) and principles for their design. We define a CHKMS as a purposeful, ethical and adaptable system that creates exoteric knowledge (relevant for solving social and managerial problems) through communicative action, providing a link between knowledge and action in an organization or community of practice. The design principles involve a strong emphasis on ethical behavior, the development of success measures for CHKMS, the need to ensure that the CHKMS enhances the dignity of humankind, a highly participatory design process, the desire to unify the designers, the decision makers and clients, the need to shape CHKMS components in relation to the system as a whole, and the need for a ""guarantor"" to validate knowledge through discursive communication and the ""cashing in"" of validity claims.

637	OODP	Theory versus practice in real-time computing with the JavaTM platform	The discipline of computer science has always featured a large gap between theory and practice. For example, both the object oriented paradigm and garbage collection techniques go back to at least the 1960s (H. Schorr and W. Waite, 1967; O.J. Dahl and K. Nygard, 1966) but they have only seen widespread commercial acceptance this decade. The JavaTM programming language has been an important factor leading to the commercial popularization of these techniques. The field of real time computing has suffered from a particularly acute disconnect between theory and practice. JavaTM technology can be applied to the building of real time systems through a set of standard extensions to the JavaTM platform. A set of extensions that bring the core benefits of the platform to real time will advance the commercial state of the art. It will help to narrow the gap between theory and practice. The paper explores different aspects of computer systems theory as applied to real time systems. It analyzes whether they are ready to be reduced to practice and standardized.		Foote, W.

639	OODP	Towards a conceptual framework and metamodel for context-aware personal cross-media information management systems	Information fragmentation is a well-known issue in personal information management (PIM). In order to overcome this problem, various PIM solutions have focussed on linking documents via semantic relationships. More recently, task-centered information management (TIM) has been introduced as an alternative PIM paradigm. While these two paradigms have their strengths and weaknesses, we aim for a new PIM system design approach to achieve better synergies with human memory. We further envision a cross-media solution where physical information is integrated with a user's digital personal information space. We present the Object-Concept-Context (OC2) conceptual framework for contextaware personal cross-media information management combining the best of the two existing PIM paradigms and integrating the most relevant features of the human memory. Further, we outline how the OC2 framework has been implemented based on a domain-specific application of the Resource-Selector-Link (RSL) hypermedia metamodel.

640	OODP	Towards a critical realist epistemology for research into E-government systems	Many governments all over the world are focusing on the transformative potential of ICT-enabled E-Government systems. It is now generally accepted that governments that adopt some form of e-government system tend to gain. As an object of inquiry within Information Systems (IS), the phenomenon of E-Government in developing countries is still quite nascent with no clear guidelines as to the appropriate epistemology for conducting research in E-Government. The objective of this paper is to discuss the object of E-Government in the context of the three predominant research paradigms: positivism, critical theory and interpretive research. The objective is to try and align research in EGovernment to the main research paradigms. The paper will also aim at proposing the most suitable research paradigm for research in E-Government systems. Analysis of the literature reveals that a number of IS researchers are refocusing on the concept of realism as an alternative for positivistic research. In particular, critical realism has been advocated for. The proposition in this paper is that E-Government is better researched using a pragmatic approach involving the use of critical theory and critical realism.

641	OODP	Towards a Pattern-based Model Transformation Approach for Design Quality Enhancement	Recently, the growing popularity of model driven frameworks and methodologies, as well as the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) initiated by Object Management Group (OMG) has implied an increasing focus on model transformation. Meanwhile, the impact of design patterns on software quality has attracted a gradual attention since design patterns encapsulate valuable knowledge to resolve design problems and improve design quality. As an attempt towards the investigation of applying goals and design patterns to realize the model transformation, we proposed, in this paper, a goal-driven model transformation by applying design patterns to transform an analysis model into its corresponding design model with an emphasis on the non-functional requirements. The use of goals makes it easier to transform the functional and non-functional requirements into the software models, and derives the candidate design patterns to help satisfy nonfunctional requirements for resolving the design problems and improving software quality.

642	OODP	Towards a software component assembly evaluation	The paradigm of Component-Based Software Engineering aims to develop software by assembling and deploying reusable units, called software components. This approach tries to improve the flexibility, re-usability and maintainability of applications, and helps develop complex and distributed applications deployed on a wide range of platforms, by plugging commercial off-the-shelf components, rather than building them from scratch. In this context, the selection step is very important. It consists of searching and selecting appropriate software components from a set of candidate components in order to satisfy the developer-specific requirements. In the selection process, both functional and non-functional requirements are generally considered. In this study, the authors propose a method enabling quality evaluation of software component assembly. This method allows us to choose the best composition in term of quality.

In this context, the selection step is very important. It consists of searching and selecting appropriate software components from a set of candidate components in order to satisfy the developer-specific requirements. In the selection process, both functional and non-functional requirements are generally considered.

643	OODP	Towards an object-oriented engineering design pattern language	The paper proposes a framework for building and using an object-oriented engineering design pattern language to enhance the cognitive performance of human designers. A design pattern is a set of recurrent design concepts represented as an object and a design pattern language is a network of objects structured by certain rules. An object-oriented network of both the recurrent and the non-recurrent design concepts can support human thinking. The network is constructed by combining the function analysis system technique (FAST) and TRIZ function modelling methods. The pattern language framework can exploit both object-oriented and object-relational features to complement and support the designer's cognitive abilities.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate an approach to analyze how students use Java and its language constructs. The approach is implemented through a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) and it is based on the analysis of the most common violations of the OO paradigm in the student source code. Moreover, the IDE supports the automatic generation of reports about student's mistakes and misconceptions that can be used by instructors to improve the course design.

645	OODP	Towards Confidence Interval Estimation in Truth Discovery	The demand for automatic extraction of true information (i.e., truths) from conflicting multi-source data has soared recently. A variety of truth discovery methods have witnessed great successes via jointly estimating source reliability and truths. All existing truth discovery methods focus on providing a point estimator for each object's truth, but in many real-world applications, confidence interval estimation of truths is more desirable, since confidence interval contains richer information. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel truth discovery method (ETCIBoot) to construct confidence interval estimates as well as identify truths, where the bootstrapping techniques are nicely integrated into the truth discovery procedure. Due to the properties of bootstrapping, the estimators obtained by ETCIBoot are more accurate and robust compared with the state-of-the-art truth discovery approaches. The proposed framework is further adapted to deal with large-scale truth discovery task in distributed paradigm. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotical consistency of the confidence interval obtained by ETCIBoot. Experimentally, we demonstrate that ETCIBoot is not only effective in constructing confidence intervals but also able to obtain better truth estimates.

646	OODP	Towards correct-by-construction product variants of a software product line: GFML, a formal language for feature modules	Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a software engineering paradigm that focuses on reuse and variability. Although feature-oriented programming (FOP) can implement software product line efficiently, we still need a method to generate and prove correctness of all product variants more efficiently and automatically. In this context, we propose to manipulate feature modules which contain three kinds of artifacts: specification, code and correctness proof. We depict a methodology and a platform that help the user to automatically produce correct-by-construction product variants from the related feature modules. As a first step of this project, we begin by proposing a language, GFML, allowing the developer to write such feature modules. This language is designed so that the artifacts can be easily reused and composed. GFML files contain the different artifacts mentioned above. The idea is to compile them into FoCaLiZe, a language for specification, implementation and formal proof with some object-oriented flavor. In this paper, we define and illustrate this language. We also introduce a way to compose the feature modules on some examples.

    abstract = ""Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a software engineering paradigm that focuses on reuse and variability. Although feature-oriented programming (FOP) can implement software product line efficiently, we still need a method to generate and prove correctness of all product variants more efficiently and automatically. In this context, we propose to manipulate feature modules which contain three kinds of artifacts: specification, code and correctness proof. We depict a methodology and a platform that help the user to automatically produce correct-by-construction product variants from the related feature modules. As a first step of this project, we begin by proposing a language, GFML, allowing the developer to write such feature modules. This language is designed so that the artifacts can be easily reused and composed. GFML files contain the different artifacts mentioned above. The idea is to compile them into FoCaLiZe, a language for specification, implementation and formal proof with some object-oriented flavor. In this paper, we define and illustrate this language. We also introduce a way to compose the feature modules on some examples. (c) T.K.Z Pham, C. Dubois \& N. Levy."",

647	OODP	Towards designing enterprises for evolvability based on fundamental engineering concepts	Contemporary organizations are operating in a hypercompetitive environment, in which they are faced with challenges such as increasing complexity and increasing change in many or all of their aspects. As such, current organizations need to be more agile to keep up with the swiftly changing business environment. However, current development practices for information systems supporting these organizations appear to be insufficient to deal with these levels of changing complexity. Normalized Systems theory therefore proposes a theoretical framework that explains why current modular structures in information systems are intrinsically limited in terms of evolvability, as well as how modular structures can be built without these limitations, thus exhibiting evolvable modularity. The goal of the proposed Ph.D. research project is to develop a contribution to how evolvable modularity as a theoretical framework can be further extended from the technological level to the business level and as such support business processes, enterprise architectures and their supporting IT systems. The ultimate purpose will be to make organizations as a whole more agile by developing so-called normalized design patterns (domain models) on the business level in order to allow a more deterministic approach enabling the 'expanding' of enterprises.

648	OODP	Towards paradigm-independent software assessment	The milestones of the history of software development are paradigm shifis. Each paradigm brought its own features and new ways of composing them to assemble software systems. Understanding the impact of paradigm shifts encompasses making comparisons among systems built with different paradigms. Performing this kind of assessments is a very difficult exercise since the characterization of software assets is generally performed using paradigm-specific quantifications. In this paper we propose a metamodel for describing software products (either source code or design models) that is paradigm-independent. This metamodel, combined with a formal quantification approach, can help performing paradigm-independent software systems assessment. We illustrate the use of the proposed metamodel on a case study comparing functionally-equivalent systems produced with OOP and AOP.

650	OODP	Towards the rapid application development based on predefined frameworks	The development of large or medium-sized domain application systems usually involves intensive workforce due to its complexity. Reuse of existing components, especially those architectural ones, could dramatically reduce the production cost and improve the quality. However, the problems related with making and adapting reusable components among different systems often inhibit the introduction of reuse. Fortunately, domainoriented application systems, especially those data-centric ones, usually share similar behaviors no matter what they server for. This paper extracts the common behaviors existing in different domains and introduces the templates based application framework, called RADF. RADF provides application skeletons and confines domain specific coding in predefined templates of classes and configuration files. The proprietary behavior of domain specific applications could be realized via simply filling codes in these templates. RADF not only consolidates the programming paradigm and provides the supporting classes for default behaviors expected in different domains, but also allows manually extending and reassembling these supporting classes. Four cases of RADF-based development have proved that RADF helps rapid application development with significantly reduced number of manually-coded source lines.

Four cases of RADF-based development have proved that RADF helps rapid application development with significantly reduced number of manually-coded source lines. (c) 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER."",

652	OODP	Transforming relational database schemas into object-oriented schemas according to ODMG-93	Many database applications are currently confronted with the problem of migrating from relational to object-oriented systems. A central task in such a process is schema conversion, which so far has to be done in a way that specifically depends on the target system. Recently, the ODMG-93 proposal has established a framework in which the core aspects of an object-oriented schema can be made precise, so that it becomes possible to do schema conversions in a system-independent way, by using the ODMG model as target. This paper presents a methodology for transforming relational schemas into object-oriented ones according to ODMG-93, thereby rendering it possible to do reverse engineering computer-assisted, and to automate database migrations. Essentially, the methodology is a three-step process who first goal is to complete a given relational schema, i.e., to make the semantic information it carries as explicit as possible using a variety of data dependencies. A completed schema is then transformed into an ODMG schema in a straightforward way, basically by generating classes from relation schemas. However, the result will in general not yet be optimal from an object-oriented perspective; so the initial object-oriented schema is finally improved to better exploit the options available in the object-oriented paradigm.

It looks at two examples of artworks with the objective of unraveling the varying modes of their transition. An event score, event-performance, object, and film drawn from the artistic legacies of George Brecht and Nam June Paik illustrate that ideas of permanence and impermanence are linked with an understanding of artworks in time and duration. While conservation reveals itself as an intervention in the temporal dimension of artworks, the theories of duration allow us to better understand the reciprocal relations between materials and meanings. In doing so, these theories acknowledge and attempt to make sense of the performative materiality of these works.

654	OODP	TransLib: An Ada 95 object oriented framework for building transactional applications	TransLib is an Ada 95 object oriented framework to program fault-tolerant applications, more concretely, it allows to program transactional distributed applications. Transactions are one of the most widely used fault-tolerance mechanisms. They provide data consistency in the presence of failures and concurrent activities. One of the novelties of TransLib is that it uncouples concurrency control and recovery code from the code of data objects used by transactions. This feature enables to use regular objects in a transactional setting and vice versa what greatly improves reusability. TransLib provides commutativity-based locking, and different kinds of recovery. It also allows users to define their own recovery and concurrency control algorithms. Transactions and exceptions have been integrated in TransLib, that is, backward and forward recovery. In this integration, exceptions that cross transaction boundaries cause transaction abortion and transaction abortions are notified as exceptions. TransLib implements a new transactional model, Group Transactions, which integrates two existing fault tolerance techniques: transactions and process groups. In this transactional model transactions can be multitask and/or multi-process. A set of design patterns documents TransLib. Each one describes a component of TransLib architecture, such as recovery and concurrency control mechanisms. In this paper we describe the overall architecture of TransLib, as well as the design patterns that document it. Additionally, some aspects of the Ada 95 implementation are also discussed.

656	OODP	Understanding BL Lacertae objects: Structural and kinematic mode changes in the BL Lac object PKS 0735+178	"Context. We present evidence that parsec-scale jets in BL Lac objects may be significantly distinct in kinematics from their counterparts in quasars. We argued this previously for the BL lac sources 1803+784 and 0716+714 and report here a similar pattern for another well-known BL Lac object, PKS 0735+178, whose nuclear jet is found to exhibit kinematics atypical of quasars. Aims. By analyzing the pc-scale jet morphology and its changes in 0735+178 we seek to understand the emission processes in BL Lac objects and to decipher their differences from quasars. A detailed study of the jet components' motion reveals that the standard AGN paradigm of apparent superluminal motion does not always describe the kinematics in BL Lac objects. We study 0735+178 here to augment and improve the understanding of the peculiar motions in the jets of BL Lac objects as a class. Methods. We analyzed 15 GHz VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) observations (2 cm/MOJAVE survey) performed at 23 epochs between 1995.27 and 2008.91. Multiple Gaussians were fitted to the derived VLBA data, to trace the kinematical and flux density evolution of the individual VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) components in the nuclear jet. We then compared the jet kinematics with the optical and radio light curves available for this BL Lac object and point out some striking correlations between the properties of the radio knots and the features in the light curves. Results. We found a drastic structural mode change in the VLBI jet of 0735+178, between 2000.4 and 2001.8 when its twice sharply bent trajectory turned into a linear shape. We further found that this jet had undergone a similar transition sometime between December 1981 and June 1983. A mode change, occurring in the reverse direction (between mid-1992 and mid-1995) has already been reported in the literature. These structural mode changes are found to be reflected in changed kinematical behavior of the nuclear jet, manifested as an apparent superluminal motion and stationarity of the radio knots. In addition, we found the individual mode changes to correlate in time with the maxima in the optical light curve. The last two transitions occurred before a (modest) radio flare. The behavior of this pc-scale jet appears to favor a scenario involving non-ballistic motions of the radio knots, produced by the precession of a continuous jet within the ambient medium. Conclusions. This is the third BL Lac object (after 1803+784 and 0716+714) analyzed by us, which reveals kinematic properties in the parsec-scale radio jet, which are atypical of quasars. For several years, the components in the jet are not found to be separating from the core but instead to be moving perpendicularly to the ridge line of the jet. In 0735+178 this unusual behavior has been particularly conspicuous. Curiously, however, fast apparent superluminal motion characteristic of quasars were present in this jet between the epochs ~1995 and ~2000. Thus we found for this BL Lac object a drastic change in the kinematics of the nuclear jet, i.e, transition from ""typical superluminal"" to an unusual ""stationary"" state. Interestingly, we found that this change is accompanied with a mode change in the nuclear jet's morphology. The long sequences of VLBA images reported here for this BL Lac object do not support the commonly assumed connection between radio flux-density outbursts and the ejection of new VLBI components. In contrast, the two mode changes seem correlated with the radio flares and are more likely an outcome of a changing viewing angle of the same knots. We propose therefore that all these observed features of the nuclear jet of 0735+178 and their correlation with the optical and radio flares might hold significant promise to better understand the basic difference between BL Lac objects and quasars."

    abstract = {Context. We present evidence that parsec-scale jets in BL Lac objects may be significantly distinct in kinematics from their counterparts in quasars. We argued this previously for the BL lac sources 1803+784 and 0716+714 and report here a similar pattern for another well-known BL Lac object, PKS 0735+178, whose nuclear jet is found to exhibit kinematics atypical of quasars. Aims. By analyzing the pc-scale jet morphology and its changes in 0735+178 we seek to understand the emission processes in BL Lac objects and to decipher their differences from quasars.

657	OODP	Understanding change-proneness in OO software through visualization	During software evolution, adaptive, and corrective maintenance are common reasons for changes. Often such changes cluster around key components. It is therefore important to analyze the frequency of changes to individual classes, but, more importantly, to also identify and show related changes in multiple classes. Frequent changes in clusters of classes may be due to their importance, due to the underlying architecture or due to chronic problems. Knowing where those change-prone clusters are can help focus attention, identify targets for re-engineering and thus provide product-based information to steer maintenance processes. This paper describes a method to identify and visualize classes and class interactions that are the most change-prone. The method was applied to a commercial embedded, real-time software system. It is object-oriented software that was developed using design patterns.

658	OODP	Understanding product lines through design patterns	Many proposals concerning design and implementation of Software Product Lines have been studied in the last few years. This work points out how and why different Design Patterns are used in the context of Product Lines. This will be achieved by reviewing how often those patterns appear in different proposed solutions and research papers for Product Lines for a given set of sources. This information will help us identify which specific problems need to be solved in the context of Product Lines. In addition, we will discuss how this information can be useful to identify gaps in new research.

659	OODP	Unified representation for Object Oriented and Relational models	The Object Oriented (OO) paradigm has wide acceptance among application developers while Relational Databases (RDB) are commonly used by most organizations, but the two model systems, OO and RDB, are incompatible. Developers of database applications often face the problem of an inherent mismatch between the two models. This paper proposes integrating OO and RDB models into a unifying conceptual model called the Flowthing Model (FM), instead of separately mapping OO and RDB concepts. FM encompasses both models and has been utilized to enhance understanding of required mapping and to provide a high-level framework for future development of a unifying model for OO and RDB technologies. It also provides a single way to conceptualize data representation.

660	OODP	Safe uniform proxies for Java	"The proxy abstraction has a long-lasting tradition in object-oriented programming. From design patterns to inherent programming language support, and from remote method invocations to simple forms of behavioral reflection, incarnations as well as applications of proxies are innumerable. Since version 1.3, Java has supported the concept of a dynamic proxy. Such an object conforms to a set of types specified by the program and can be used wherever an expression of any of these types is expected, yet it reifies invocations performed on it.

    abstract = {The proxy abstraction has a long-lasting tradition in object-oriented programming. From design patterns to inherent programming language support, and from remote method invocations to simple forms of behavioral reflection, incarnations as well as applications of proxies are innumerable. Since version 1.3, Java has supported the concept of a dynamic proxy. Such an object conforms to a set of types specified by the program and can be used wherever an expression of any of these types is expected, yet it reifies invocations performed on it. This ability has allowed dynamic proxies to be used to implement paradigms such as behavioral reflection, structural conformance, or multi-methods. Alas, these proxies are only available ""for interfaces"". The case of creating dynamic proxies for a set of types including a class has not been addressed, meaning that it is currently not possible to create a dynamic proxy that conforms to an application-defined class type. This weakness strongly limits any application of dynamic proxies beyond the inherent limitations of proxies, which have motivated deeper programming language support for features such as behavioral reflection. In this paper, we unfold the current support for dynamic proxies in Java, assessing it in the light of a set of generic criteria for proxy implementations.

661	OODP	Up-to-date key retrieval for information centric networking	Information Centric Networking (ICN) leverages in-network caching to provide efficient data distribution and better performance by replicating contents in multiple nodes to bring content nearer the users. Since contents are stored and replicated into node caches, the content validity must be assured end-to-end. Each content object carries a digital signature to provide a proof of its integrity, authenticity, and provenance. However, the use of digital signatures requires a key management infrastructure to manage the key life cycle. To perform a proper signature verification, a node needs to know whether the signing key is valid or it has been revoked. This paper discusses how to retrieve up-to-date signing keys in the ICN scenario. In the usual public key infrastructure, the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) or the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enable applications to obtain the revocation status of a certificate. However, the push-based distribution of Certificate Revocation Lists and the request/response paradigm of Online Certificate Status Protocol should be fit in the mechanism of named-data. We consider three possible approaches to distribute up-to-date keys in a similar way to the current CRL and OCSP. Then, we suggest a fourth protocol leveraging a set of distributed notaries, which naturally fits the ICN scenario. Finally, we evaluate the number and size of exchanged messages of each solution, and then we compare the methods considering the perceived latency by the end nodes and the throughput on the network links.

662	OODP	Using abstract dependences to localize faults from procedural programs	Use of fault localization in control engineering where engineers often employ the procedural programming paradigm. Often control software is safety-critical and thus detection but also localization of bugs is uttermost important. Detecting and locating faults is one of the most important phase of Software Engineering. Many efforts have been taken to improve software development and to prevent faults. But still software faults pose that most challenging problems to software engineers .This article makes use of abstract dependencies between program variables for locating faults in programs. We motivate the underline theory and give experimental results. Our fault localization model is based on previous work that uses the abstract dependencies for fault detection.

663	OODP	Using aspect oriented techniques to build-in software quality	Today's software systems are growing rapidly in number, size, complexity, amount of distribution and number of users with the evolving technologies being geared towards improving their quality. Aspect oriented software development is a new paradigm that claims to improve the quality of software using separation of concerns. In this paper we show how the aspect oriented paradigm has evolved from the object oriented paradigm, giving definitions of key aspect oriented terms to aid comprehension and clarification. We then show how techniques involved in aspect oriented design can help to improve software quality. B) 2012 International Journal of Computer Science Issues.		Ekabua, Obeten O.

665	OODP	Using patterns in design and documentation of software	In software development, as well as in other areas of life and science, recurring themes and structures are encountered. By expressly describing them together with the underlying considerations and decisions in an abstract manner, i.e. in a pattern form, the knowledge and experience of the developers can be recorded in a structured and systematic way. Such patterns may then be used by other developers to reuse that recorded experience. Furthermore, patterns help to improve the quality of software documentation. The paper first gives an introduction to the pattern subject. The authors then discuss their experience with using patterns. In this discussion particular attention is paid to some problems associated with pattern employment.		Gerth, Th. (1); Schachtschabel, R. (1); Schonefeld, R. (1)	WOON. White Object-Oriented Nights.

667	OODP	Using tropos to model agent based architectures for adaptive systems: A case study in ambient intelligence	The realization of complex distributed applications required in areas such as e-Business, e-Government, and ambient intelligence calls for new software development paradigms, such as the Service Oriented Computing approach, which accommodates for dynamic and adaptive interaction schemata, carried on at a peer-to-peer level. Multi Agent Systems promise to offer the natural architectural solutions to several requirements imposed by such an adaptive approach.

671	OODP	Validation of object oriented software design with fault tree analysis	Software plays an increasing role in the safety critical systems. Increasing the quality and reliability of the software has become the major objective of software development industry. Researchers and industry practitioners, look for innovative techniques and methodologies that could be used to increase their confidence in the software reliability. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is one method under study at the Software Assurance Technology Center (SATC) of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center to determine its relevance to increasing the quality and the reliability of software. This paper briefly reviews some of the previous research in the area of software fault tree analysis (SFTA). Next we discuss a roadmap for application of the SFTA to software, with special emphasis on object-oriented design. This is followed by a brief discussion of the paradigm for transforming a software design artifact (i.e., sequence diagram) to its corresponding software fault tree. Finally, we discuss challenges, advantages and disadvantages of SFTA.

This paper briefly reviews some of the previous research in the area of software fault tree analysis (SFTA). Next we discuss a roadmap for application of the SFTA to software, with special emphasis on object-oriented design. This is followed by a brief discussion of the paradigm for transforming a software design artifact (i.e., sequence diagram) to its corresponding software fault tree. Finally, we discuss challenges, advantages and disadvantages of SFTA. (c) 2004 IEEE."",

672	OODP	Value-added services at Geo derived from persistent observation	At the present time in 2019, persistent observation of space objects near Geosynchronous Orbit has been achieved. With greater than 300 telescopes observing better than 3000 objects above 8000 km altitude, ExoAnalytic Solutions provides significant capability derived from an ~18 hour per day duty cycle with continuous observations of deep space objects (>750,000 observations across the deep space object population per night). In this work we establish a technical definition for when space objects are observed persistently and explain key value-added services which are supported by such a data collection strategy. We compare this to the timelines and characteristics of common, anomalous, and evolving deep space traffic events including spacecraft maneuvers, slot changes, changes in orientation, and debris producing events observed. In contrast to historical trends which have led to the current state of the art in basic Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Space Traffic Management (STM) services, we summarize many other useful and informative services which are supported by a persistent observation approach. These services go beyond coarse conjunction assessment achieved by fusing data from sparse and heterogeneous sensors. In addition, the frequency at which deep space object measurements collected by geometrically distributed optical sensors may be mapped to new, precise state vector estimates is investigated and compared. We argue that predictive analytics based on more frequent state vector estimates result in a more reliable understanding of modern deep space objects than predictions derived from sparse data collections which are mapped to state vectors with less frequency. Finally, an option for a democratized approach to space traffic management for deep space objects is discussed which enables GEO operators to opt-in to services focused on their systems and based on a persistent data paradigm. Such an approach has the potential to significantly reduce the occurrence of non-precise conjunction warnings, support additional services such as antenna calibration, and enables a bottom-up approach to space traffic management which keeps spacecraft operators, the ultimate customer for STM services, in control.

673	OODP	Variable granularity access tracking scheme for improving the performance of software transactional memory	Software transactional memory (STM) has been proposed as a promising programming paradigm for shared memory multi-threaded programs as an alternative to conventional lock based synchronization primitives. Typical STM implementations employ a conflict detection scheme, which works with uniform access granularity, tracking shared data accesses either at word/cache line or at object level. It is well known that a single fixed access tracking granularity cannot meet the conflicting goals of reducing false conflicts without impacting concurrency adversely. A fine grained granularity while improving concurrency can have an adverse impact on performance due to lock aliasing, lock validation overheads, and additional cache pressure. On the other hand, a coarse grained granularity can impact performance due to reduced concurrency. Thus, in general, a fixed or uniform granularity access tracking (UGAT) scheme is application-unaware and rarely matches the access patterns of individual application or parts of an application, leading to sub-optimal performance for different parts of the application(s). In order to mitigate the disadvantages associated with UGAT scheme, we propose a Variable Granularity Access Tracking (VGAT) scheme in this paper. We propose a compiler based approach wherein the compiler uses inter-procedural whole program static analysis to select the access tracking granularity for different shared data structures of the application based on the application's data access pattern. We describe our prototype VGAT scheme, using TL2 as our STM implementation. Our experimental results reveal that VGAT-STM scheme can improve the application performance of STAMP benchmarks from 1.87% to up to 21.2%.	compiler;; software transactional memory	Mannarswamy, S.S.

675	OODP	Visual servoing based pickup of stationary objects with a dynamically controlled manipulator	The visual servoing based pickup of stationary objects (or regulation, etc.) has attracted many academic researchers and industrial engineers over the past two decades, and numerous control strategies are proposed for this challenging problem. The controller proposed in this paper follows the Position Based Visual Servoing (PBVS) paradigm. Most of the PBVS controllers, if not all, are designed assuming that the position of the manipulator end effector and that of the stationary object have been accurately recovered with the vision-based estimators. Therefore the rigorous stabilities of such controller/estimator strategies cannot be promised due to the separation principle does not hold for the general nonlinear systems. Accordingly, a new dynamic PBVS controller is proposed in this paper for the visually servoed pickup of stationary objects by embedding two novel adaptive estimators into this new controller to estimate the position of the manipulator end effctor and that of the stationary object online. The dynamic model of the manipulator is considered in the controller design to improve the transient performance. It is proved by Lyapunov theory that this adaptive controller/estimator strategy gives rise to the asymptotic pickup of stationary objects and the convergence of the estimated positions to the actual ones. An experiment is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller/estimator strategy.

676	OODP	Visualization of Object-Oriented Variability Implementations as Cities	Many large software systems are variability-rich, object-oriented, and implemented in a single code base. They then rely on multiple traditional techniques (inheritance, patterns) to realize variability, making these implementations not explicit. This directly hampers the comprehension of variability implementations, especially for newcomers in a project that need, in a short time, to understand the most important parts. In this paper, we propose VariCity, a visualization using the city metaphor to exhibit zones of interest, being zones of high density of variability implementations. The different forms of variability implementations are first detected through the usage of symmetries in code (e.g., inheritance defines a substitution symmetry between the immutable part of the superclass and the possible changes in its subclasses). VariCity then creates a 3D city representation with buildings being classes while the metrics on the number of symmetries (e.g., the number of overloaded methods, influence the building size, and their color if they are heavily loaded in symmetries). Contrary to the usual package-based organization in code-related city representations, the city streets are arranged according to the usage relationships between classes. Inheritance is simply represented with hoverable aerial links. Variability-related design patterns are depicted as buildings with specific geometric forms, while some classes specified as entry points can help in shaping the whole city organization. We also report on the evaluation of VariCity on a set of large object-oriented systems, showing that several usage scenarios helping a newcomer to spot critical variability-related zones are covered.

    abstract = ""The visually servoed pickup (or grasping, tracking, etc.) of moving objects has attracted many academic researchers and industrial engineers over the past two decades, and numerous control strategies are proposed for this challenging problem. The controller proposed in this paper follows the Position Based Visual Servoing (PBVS) paradigm. Most of the PBVS controllers, if not all, are designed assuming that the position of the manipulator end effector and that of the moving object have been accurately recovered with the vision-based estimators. Therefore the rigorous stabilities of such controller-/estimator strategies cannot be promised due to the separation principle does not hold for the general nonlinear systems.

679	OODP	Which education requirements for computer science?	The service oriented economy challenges the software engineer in today's industry. Some experience from daily work points to deficiencies of the computer science education with respect to these challenges. However, they also hint at measures to repair theses deficiencies. The arguments illustrate, that focussing the education on object technology not only fulfills an immediate request of today's industry but also opens further opportunities for improvement. We argue to emphasize communication, modelling, design and design patterns over languages.		Krasemann, H.

681	OODP	Will a dominant standard for Object-Oriented system development emerge?	The lack of a dominant Object-Oriented (OO) standard has been a hindrance to the OO paradigm's successful adoption on a large scale. Currently, within different versions of OO methodologies, various OO concepts can exist under different names and interpretations. While recently there have been some attempts to standardize OO systems development, until now, no standard has emerged as the dominant standard in practice. The objective of this paper is to assess benefits of a dominant standard, and to investigate strengths and weaknesses of the current approaches towards standardization. Based on this investigation, we outline how these different standardization approaches can contribute toward the emergence of a dominant standard. We conclude that a metamodelling approach, combined with argumentation and ontology when necessary, has the best chances to achieve the goal that, to quote Snyder, `those applying OO technology will one day speak the same language'.

682	OODP	Work in progress: Transitioning from novice to expert software engineers through design patterns: Is it really working?	Since their wide adoption by the software engineering community in the mid-90's, design patterns have become an important educational component in the training of novice software engineers due to the common belief that, as distilled experience of seasoned software designers, they can transform novice software engineers into skilled professionals in a relatively short time frame. This paper questions the validity of this commonly-held belief about the educational value of conventional patterns, arguing that although there is tremendous value in capturing and disseminating software engineering experience in the form of patterns, conventional design patterns cannot deliver on this expectation to significantly shorten the experience growth curve. We report initial results from an ongoing research project that aims to not only identify the difficulties in using conventional patterns as educational means for novices, but also to use such insights to develop new forms of patterns to help educators and experts to more effectively communicate and transfer their software engineering knowledge, experience, and understanding of best practices to novices.

    abstract = ""Since their wide adoption by the software engineering community in the mid-90's, design patterns have become an important educational component in the training of novice software engineers due to the common belief that, as distilled experience of seasoned software designers, they can transform novice software engineers into skilled professionals in a relatively short time frame. This paper questions the validity of this commonly-held belief about the educational value of conventional patterns, arguing that although there is tremendous value in capturing and disseminating software engineering experience in the form of patterns, conventional design patterns cannot deliver on this expectation to significantly shorten the experience growth curve. We report initial results from an ongoing research project that aims to not only identify the difficulties in using conventional patterns as educational means for novices, but also to use such insights to develop new forms of patterns to help educators and experts to more effectively communicate and transfer their software engineering knowledge, experience, and understanding of best practices to novices.

683	OODP	Wrapping Stored Procedures: an Enhanced Object Oriented Approach	Object-oriented is the most successful programming paradigm. Relational database management systems are the most successful data storage components. In spite of their success and their tight binding, they always had different points of view on data and applications. They are not integrated, fostering some difficulties when applications and data storage components must collaborate. In this paper, we explore one facet for that integration presenting new enhancements for an object-oriented approach for wrapping database stored procedures	Wrapping; Object oriented databases; Memory; Logic; Object oriented programming; Relational databases; Collaboration; Data security; Scalability; Java; Stored Procedures; Tight-binding; Different Points Of View; Relational Database Management System; Collection Methods; Usage In Applications; Clone Detection; Standard Interface; Regular Elements; database; layer; object-oriented; stored procedures; wrap	O.N.

684	OODP	Zoom navigation exploring large information and application spaces	We present the concept of ZOOM NAVIGATION, a new interaction paradigm to cope with visualization and navigation problems as found in large information and application spaces. It is based on the pluggable zoom, an object-oriented component derived from the variable zoom fisheye algorithm. Working with a limited screen space we apply a degree-of-inierest (DOI) function to guide the level of detail used in presenting information. Furthermore we determine the user's information and navigation needs by analysing the interaction history. This leads to the definition of the aspect-of-interest (AOI) function. The AOI is evaluated in order to choose one of the several information aspects, under which an item can be studied. This allows us to change navigational affordance and thereby enhance navigation. In this paper we describe the ideas behind the pluggable zoom and the definition of DOI and AOI functions. The application of these functions is demonstrated within two case studies, the ZOOM ILLUSTRATOR and the ZOOM NAVIGATOR. We discuss our experience with these implemented systems.
