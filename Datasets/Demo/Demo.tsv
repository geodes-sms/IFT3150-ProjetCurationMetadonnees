0	Demo	Fiber orientation measurement from mesoscale CT scans of prepreg platelet molded composites	"X-ray computed tomography (CT) analysis is used to measure the heterogeneous fiber orientation fields in a 20 cm3 composite bracket made from prepreg platelet-based molding compound (PPMC). The as-molded mesostructure of the complete geometry is captured using material density gradients in 50 um resolution CT scans without the need to resolve individual fibers. Fiber collimation and physical density gradients within intact platelets of this material system facilitates nondestructive assessment of average local fiber orientation at the component scale. Microscopy-based validation of the local orientation measurements indicate the accuracy that can be attained utilizing the density-based structure tensor CT analysis method. Local orientation field measurements for the complete geometry can be mapped into a ""digital twin"" model, for purposes such as experimental performance simulation and validation of molding process orientation state predictions. Composite designers, analysts, and material suppliers can employ this methodology to more confidently utilize PPMCs and morphologically similar composite material systems."	A. Prepreg;  B.

1	Demo	Dynamic fault injection into digital twins of safety-critical systems	In this work we present a technology for dynamically introducing fault structures into digital twins without the need to change the virtual prototype model. The injection is done at the beginning of a simulation by dynamically rewiring the involved netlists. During the simulation on a realtime platform, faults can be activated or deactivated triggered by sequences, statistical effects or by events from the real world. In some cases the fault structures can even be auto-generated directly from a formal specification, which further automates the development process for safety-relevant systems. The approach is demonstrated at a SystemC/ SystemC AMS virtual prototype of a safety-critical sub-systems which runs on a dSPACE real-time hardware.

2	Demo	Towards Security-Aware Virtual Environments for Digital Twins	Digital twins open up new possibilities in terms of monitoring, simulating, optimizing and predicting the state of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Furthermore, we argue that a fully functional, virtual replica of a CPS can also play an important role in securing the system. In this work, we present a framework that allows users to create and execute digital twins, closely matching their physical counterparts. We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.	simulation;  security monitoring;  industrial control systems;  digital twin;  cyber-physical systems;  automationml; simulation, security monitoring, industrial control systems, digital twin, cyber-physical systems, automationml	Eckhart, Matthias; Ekelhart, Andreas	CPSS '18: Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical System Security	https://doi.org/10.1145/3198458.3198464		61-72	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3198458.3198464,

3	Demo	Digital Twin Application for the Temperature and Steam Flow Monitoring of a Food Pasteurization Pilot Plant	In this paper, the development of a Digital Twin of a beverages pasteurization system for temperature monitoring, using NI Lab-VIEW control system toolkit, is described. A cyber-physical production system, composed of a real-time simulation tool and a controller, has been set up and tested on a pilot plant set up in a university laboratory. The paper shows how the software platform, together with the hardware, has been implemented in a traditional system, not (yet) ready for Industry 4.0 technologies, and therefore underlines the main issues occurred during its development. The Digital Twin includes a CompactRIO controller and a set of probes, connected with the controller. The aim of the Digital Twin is to monitor the machine status, with a particular attention to the temperature reached by the service water and the required steam flow. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this system, a set of experimental tests has also been carried out.

4	Demo	Chip to city: The future of mobility	Cities of the future will be founded on the transmission of data between various intelligent systems, including the design, manufacturing, and deployment of autonomous vehicles. As automotive companies transition from building and selling cars to offering mobility services, integrated solutions for information technology, product lifecycle management, and various engineering domains will be critical to success. Among these engineering domains, the development of advanced system-on-chip (SoC) devices will be especially crucial to the success of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles demand bespoke SoC devices that are optimized for the specific challenges of automated driving. Legacy automotive manufacturers, automotive suppliers, and new entrants developing autonomous vehicles will need to adopt a cross-domain approach to semiconductor development that enables early verification and validation of SoCs within the context of an autonomous vehicle. Integrating such a portfolio into a digital automotive enterprise will enable companies as they strive to realize the potential of new mobility technologies.
