0	Demo	Cyber-physical-system for representing a robot end effector	Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is a method to program robots through the performance of a task by humans. Most implementations are online methods that use visual or force feedback of the demonstrator. However, we developed an offline programming approach for PbD with a special input device within an Augmented Reality Environment. Therefore, this paper aims to answer how the characteristics and functionality of the end effector of a jointed-arm robot can be represented by a haptic input device in order to perform PbD. The PbD process is first carried out on a digital twin of the robot, visualized to the user in real physical space by means of augmented reality technology. The programming of the digital twin can later be transferred to the real robot. The haptic input device in this context is the main part of the Cyber-Physical-System (CPS), which enables the user to interact with the virtual robot. Therefore, the specification of the mechanical and software components of the CPS is of main importance. Within this paper, strategies for the implementation of shape and function abstraction, as well as for ensuring communication, have been worked out. The physical shape of the CPS is kept generic and is only subject to ergonomic restrictions. However, Augmented Reality overlays the physical shape with an exact digital image of the end effector used later in the process. Nevertheless, the physical characteristics of the real robot should be represented as real as possible by the CPS. Therefore, the CPS is equipped with various sensors and actuators. With the CPS it is possible to determine contact forces and to manipulate objects to a certain extent in order to teach gripping strategies to the digital twin. An operating system was developed for communication and control of the electronic components. For the validation of the functionality of the CPS an exemplary PbD process was developed, the results were analyzed and evaluated.	industrial robot;  cyber physical system;  programming by demonstration;  digital twin;  augmented reality; industrial robot, cyber physical system, programming by demonstration, digital twin, augmented reality	Muller, Fabian; Deuerlein, Christian; Koch, Michael	Procedia CIRP	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2021.05.071		307-312	"""@article{MULLER2021307,

1	Demo	Dynamic fault injection into digital twins of safety-critical systems	In this work we present a technology for dynamically introducing fault structures into digital twins without the need to change the virtual prototype model. The injection is done at the beginning of a simulation by dynamically rewiring the involved netlists. During the simulation on a realtime platform, faults can be activated or deactivated triggered by sequences, statistical effects or by events from the real world. In some cases the fault structures can even be auto-generated directly from a formal specification, which further automates the development process for safety-relevant systems. The approach is demonstrated at a SystemC/ SystemC AMS virtual prototype of a safety-critical sub-systems which runs on a dSPACE real-time hardware.

2	Demo	Towards Security-Aware Virtual Environments for Digital Twins	Digital twins open up new possibilities in terms of monitoring, simulating, optimizing and predicting the state of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Furthermore, we argue that a fully functional, virtual replica of a CPS can also play an important role in securing the system. In this work, we present a framework that allows users to create and execute digital twins, closely matching their physical counterparts. We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.	automationml;  cyber-physical systems;  digital twin;  industrial control systems;  security monitoring;  simulation; automationml, cyber-physical systems, digital twin, industrial control systems, security monitoring, simulation	Eckhart, Matthias; Ekelhart, Andreas	CPSS '18: Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical System Security	https://doi.org/10.1145/3198458.3198464		61-72	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3198458.3198464,

3	Demo	Digital Twin Application for the Temperature and Steam Flow Monitoring of a Food Pasteurization Pilot Plant	In this paper, the development of a Digital Twin of a beverages pasteurization system for temperature monitoring, using NI Lab-VIEW control system toolkit, is described. A cyber-physical production system, composed of a real-time simulation tool and a controller, has been set up and tested on a pilot plant set up in a university laboratory. The paper shows how the software platform, together with the hardware, has been implemented in a traditional system, not (yet) ready for Industry 4.0 technologies, and therefore underlines the main issues occurred during its development. The Digital Twin includes a CompactRIO controller and a set of probes, connected with the controller. The aim of the Digital Twin is to monitor the machine status, with a particular attention to the temperature reached by the service water and the required steam flow. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this system, a set of experimental tests has also been carried out.

4	Demo	Chip to city: The future of mobility	Cities of the future will be founded on the transmission of data between various intelligent systems, including the design, manufacturing, and deployment of autonomous vehicles. As automotive companies transition from building and selling cars to offering mobility services, integrated solutions for information technology, product lifecycle management, and various engineering domains will be critical to success. Among these engineering domains, the development of advanced system-on-chip (SoC) devices will be especially crucial to the success of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles demand bespoke SoC devices that are optimized for the specific challenges of automated driving. Legacy automotive manufacturers, automotive suppliers, and new entrants developing autonomous vehicles will need to adopt a cross-domain approach to semiconductor development that enables early verification and validation of SoCs within the context of an autonomous vehicle. Integrating such a portfolio into a digital automotive enterprise will enable companies as they strive to realize the potential of new mobility technologies.

5	Demo	Combined development and test of product-service systems in early product development stages for customized, availability-oriented business models in the capital goods industry	Availability-Oriented Product-Service Systems (AOPSS) give manufacturers of capital goods the opportunity to expand their offerings while fulfilling the customers' needs for product availability. In turn, they generate special requirements for the early product development phase. Condition monitoring has to be taken into account, which results in a contradiction since learning-based condition monitoring approaches require large amounts of data which isn't available in that particular stage. Techniques from model-based systems engineering allow solving problems newly arising when developing parts or products in AOPSS. The approach proposed in the paper is being illustrated based on a use case from the agricultural industry.
