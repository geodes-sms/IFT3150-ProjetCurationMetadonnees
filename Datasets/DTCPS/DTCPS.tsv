0	DTCPS	Fiber orientation measurement from mesoscale CT scans of prepreg platelet molded composites	"X-ray computed tomography (CT) analysis is used to measure the heterogeneous fiber orientation fields in a 20 cm3 composite bracket made from prepreg platelet-based molding compound (PPMC). The as-molded mesostructure of the complete geometry is captured using material density gradients in 50 um resolution CT scans without the need to resolve individual fibers. Fiber collimation and physical density gradients within intact platelets of this material system facilitates nondestructive assessment of average local fiber orientation at the component scale. Microscopy-based validation of the local orientation measurements indicate the accuracy that can be attained utilizing the density-based structure tensor CT analysis method. Local orientation field measurements for the complete geometry can be mapped into a ""digital twin"" model, for purposes such as experimental performance simulation and validation of molding process orientation state predictions. Composite designers, analysts, and material suppliers can employ this methodology to more confidently utilize PPMCs and morphologically similar composite material systems."	A. Prepreg;  B.

2	DTCPS	Exploring critical success factors influencing adoption of digital twin and physical internet in electronics industry using grey-DEMATEL approach	Digital twin and physical internet adoption based on advanced digital technologies is gaining significance in the recent times. Digital twin is one of the enabling technologies that link actual physical system with its virtual depiction using advanced digital technologies. In order to leverage its potential, firms have instigated to adopt digital twin and physical internet for real-world applications. Although researches on impact of information technology in supply chains exists, a study on the modelling aspects by analysing critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet is limited. We have addressed this gap by developing a structural model for identifying the inter-relationships and cause effect parameters of critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet. Thirteen critical success factors were shortlisted based on literature review and in consultation with experts. An integrated Grey- based, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)is used to visualize the causal relationships among critical success factors and verified by applying the proposed model in an electronics manufacturing firm. Sensitivity analysis has been done to check accuracy of results and robustness of the study. The results reveal that top management commitment and support and long, medium and short term planning are the most influential factors impacting the adoption of digital twin and physical internet in electronics industry. Findings of this research provide insights for supply chain managers and academicians by identifying the cause and effect group critical success factors for effective adoption of digital twin and physical internet.

3	DTCPS	Error identification of measurement software based on digital twin of gear measuring center	The verification of measurement software has become a challenge as more types of workpiece being measured with gear measuring centers and the increasing complexity of measurement software. In this research, the digital twin of a gear measuring center (DTGMC) was constructed as an evaluation platform for various types of measurement software. Various digital workpieces instead of physical artifacts were measured on the DTGMC. Based on this platform, the evaluation methods for the measurement software were discussed, and three experiments were carried out. The involute measurement model was identified using multiple digital workpieces with known errors. The probe compensation algorithm was identified using different radii probes and a pin. Three position compensation algorithms were also verified using loading different motion errors. The results showed that the evaluation methods based on the DTGMC could effectively identify various errors in measurement software, providing a new concept for the independent evaluation of measurement software.

5	DTCPS	Digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of flow-type smart manufacturing systems	The COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that dramatically impacted human lives and economic activities. Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.

The proposed state-of-charge estimation with an adaptive extended H-infinity filter is robust and accurate for both lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries, even with a significant initialization error. Furthermore, a state-of-health estimation algorithm with particle swarm optimization is innovatively exploited to monitor both capacity fade and power fade of the battery during aging.

8	DTCPS	Digital twin-enabled Graduation Intelligent Manufacturing System for fixed-position assembly islands	The layout of fixed-position assembly islands is widely used in the heavy equipment industry, where the product remains at one assembly island for its entire assembly period, while required workers, equipment, and materials are moved to the island according to the assembly plan. Such layout is not only suitable for producing bulky or fragile products, but also offers considerable flexibility and competitive operational efficiency for products with medium variety and volumes. However, due to inherent complexity of the product, sophisticated assembly operations heavily rely on skilled operators, and the complexity and uncertainty are high and amplified by such massive manual interventions as well as the unique routing patterns of the fixed-position assembly process. Aiming at reducing the complexity and uncertainty, this paper introduces a digital twin-enabled Graduation Intelligent Manufacturing System (DT-GiMS) for fixed-position assembly islands. Inspired by the success of graduation ceremony, an assembly system-Graduation Manufacturing System (GMS) is proposed for fixed-position assembly islands, in which job tickets, setup tickets, operation tickets, and logistics tickets are designed to organize the production activities. Following the concept of digital twin, unified digital representations with appropriate sets of information are created at object level, product level, and system level, respectively. Through Internet of Things (IoT), smart gateway, Web 3D and industrial wearable technologies, vital information including identity, status, geometric model, and production process can be captured and mapped in physical space, and converged and synchronized with their digital representations in twin (cloud) space on a real-time basis. The overall framework of DT-GiMS is presented with physical layer, digital layer, and service layer. Real-time convergence and synchronization among them ensure that right resources are allocated and utilized to the right activities at the right time with enhanced visibility. Considering customer demand and production capacity constraints, real-time ticket pool management mechanisms are proposed to manage production activities in a near-optimal way under DT-GiMS. With the support of cloud-based services provided in service layer in DT-GiMS, managers could easily make production decisions, and onsite operators could efficiently complete their daily tasks with nearly error-free operations with enhanced visibility. A demonstrative case is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed concept and approach.

9	DTCPS	Digital twin-driven rapid reconfiguration of the automated manufacturing system via an open architecture model	Increasing individualization demands in products call for high flexibility in the manufacturing systems to adapt changes. This paper proposes a novel digital twin-driven approach for rapid reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems. The digital twin comprises two parts, the semi-physical simulation that maps data of the system and provides input data to the second part, which is optimization. The results of the optimization part are fed back to the semi-physical simulation for verification. Open-architecture machine tool (OAMT) is defined and developed as a new class of machine tools comprising a fixed standard platform and various individualized modules that can be added and rapidly swapped. Engineers can flexibly reconfigure the manufacturing system for catering to process planning by integrating personalized modules into its OAMTs.

This paper proposes a novel digital twin-driven approach for rapid reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems. The digital twin comprises two parts, the semi-physical simulation that maps data of the system and provides input data to the second part, which is optimization. The results of the optimization part are fed back to the semi-physical simulation for verification. Open-architecture machine tool (OAMT) is defined and developed as a new class of machine tools comprising a fixed standard platform and various individualized modules that can be added and rapidly swapped. Engineers can flexibly reconfigure the manufacturing system for catering to process planning by integrating personalized modules into its OAMTs.

10	DTCPS	Construction method of shop-floor digital twin based on MBSE	"Digital twin (DT) technology is essential for achieving the fusion of virtual-real cyber-physical systems. Academics and companies have made great strides in the theoretical research and case studies of constructing the shop-floor digital twin (SDT), which is the premise of applying DT technology on the shop floor. A shop floor is a large complex system that involves many elements including people, machines, materials, methods, and the environment and processes, such as the technical flow, business process, logistics, and control flow. However, most of the developed cases lack a hierarchical, structured and modularized implementation framework for the development of an SDT system, which leads to problems such as a low reuse rate of the system blocks, lack of scalability, and high upgrade and maintenance costs. In response to these issues, we propose a construction method of the DT for the shop floor based on model-based systems engineering from the perspective of the system. In this method, a comprehensive DT model for the shop floor is gradually constructed by using system modeling language, the modeling method ""MagicGrid,"" and the ""V model"" of systems engineering.

12	DTCPS	Digital twin-based industrial cloud robotics: Framework, control approach and implementation	Industrial cloud robotics (ICR) integrates cloud computing with industrial robots (IRs). The capabilities of industrial robots can be encapsulated as cloud services and used for ubiquitous manufacturing. Currently, the digital models for process simulation, path simulation, etc. are encapsulated as cloud services. The digital models in the cloud may not reflect the real state of the physical robotic manufacturing systems due to inaccurate or delayed condition update and therefore result in inaccurate simulation and robotic control. Digital twin can be used to realize fine sensing control of the physical manufacturing systems by a combination of high-fidelity digital model and sensory data. In this paper, we propose a framework of digital twin-based industrial cloud robotics (DTICR) for industrial robotic control and its key methodologies. The DTICR is divided into physical IR, digital IR, robotic control services, and digital twin data. First, the robotic control capabilities are encapsulated as Robot Control as-a-Service (RCaaS) based on manufacturing features and feature-level robotic capability model. Then the available RCaaSs are ranked and parsed. After manufacturing process simulation with digital IR models, RCaaSs are mapped to physical robots for robotic control. The digital IR models are connected to the physical robots and updated by sensory data. A case is implemented to demonstrate the workflow of DTICR. The results show that DTICR is capable to synchronize and merge digital IRs and physical IRs effectively. The bidirectional interaction between digital IRs and physical IRs enables fine sensing control of IRs. The proposed DTICR is also flexible and extensible by using ontology models.

13	DTCPS	Digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability for complex products	Complex products such as satellites, missiles, and aircraft typically have demanding requirements for dynamic data management and process traceability. The assembly process for these complex products involves high complexity, strong dynamics, many uncertainties, and frequent rework and repair, especially in the model development stage. Achieving assembly data management and process traceability for complex products has always been a challenge. A recently proposed solution involves one-to-one mapping of the corresponding physical entity, also known as the digital twin method. This paper proposes a digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability approach for complex products. First, the dynamic evolutionary process of complex product assembly data was analyzed from three dimensions: granularity, period and version. Then, a framework of digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability for complex products was constructed. Some core techniques are: 1) workflow-based product assembly data organization and version management; 2) synchronous modeling of the product assembly process based on digital twin; and 3) hierarchical management and traceability of product assembly data based on digital twin. On this basis, an algorithm flowchart for generating a product assembly data package was created, which includes product assembly data management, assembly process traceability, and generation of a product assembly data package. Furthermore, the Digital Twin-based Assembly Process Management and Control System (DT-APMCS) was designed to verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. Some aerospace-related assembly enterprises are currently using DT-APMCS and achieving satisfactory results. Finally, a summary of our work is given, and the future research work is also discussed.

14	DTCPS	Bi-level dynamic scheduling architecture based on service unit digital twin agents	Pure reactive scheduling is one of the core technologies to solve the complex dynamic disturbance factors in real-time. The emergence of CPS, digital twin, cloud computing, big data and other new technologies based on the industrial Internet enables information acquisition and pure reactive scheduling more practical to some extent. However, how to build a new architecture to solve the problems which traditional dynamic scheduling methods cannot solve becomes a new research challenge. Therefore, this paper designs a new bi-level distributed dynamic workshop scheduling architecture, which is based on the workshop digital twin scheduling agent and multiple service unit digital twin scheduling agents. Within this architecture, scheduling a physical workshop is decomposed to the whole workshop scheduling in the first level and its service unit scheduling in the second level. On the first level, the whole workshop scheduling is executed by its virtual workshop coordination (scheduling) agent embedded with the workshop digital twin consisting of multi-service unit digital twins. On the second level, each service unit scheduling coordinated by the first level scheduling is executed in a distributed way by the corresponding service unit scheduling agent associated with its service unit digital twin. The benefits of the new architecture include (1) if a dynamic scheduling only requires a single service unit scheduling, it will then be performed in the corresponding service unit scheduling without involving other service units, which will make the scheduling locally, simply and robustly. (2) when a dynamic scheduling requires changes in multiple service units in a coordinated way, the first level scheduling will be executed and then coordinate the second level service unit scheduling accordingly. This divide-and-then-conquer strategy will make the scheduling easier and practical. The proposed architecture has been tested to illustrate its feasibility and practicality.

A passive biped robot prototype is developed based on the model. The prototype is equipped with a wireless sensor measuring system to enable data acquisition. The highlight of this work is the high degree of coincidence achieved between the passive response of the numerically simulated mathematical model, the response obtained by a multibody dynamics simulation, and the experimentally obtained response of the physical passive walking robot.

16	DTCPS	Development of an edge computing-based cyber-physical machine tool	Digital twin is a virtual model that represents physical entities in a digital manner. By leveraging means of data to simulate the behavior of physical entities in the real environment, the functions of physical entities can be optimized and expanded, through virtual and real interaction feedback, data fusion, decision making, and optimization. Despite numerous researches on digital twin concept and its applications, scarcely any discusses about the computation efficiency of the twin established. In order to shorten the latency of mapping and reduce the high computation workload in the cloud, this paper develops a cyber-physical machine tool based on edge computing techniques, to realize remote sensing, real-time monitoring and scalable high-performance digital twin application. Furthermore, a novel edge computing algorithm is proposed to detect the abnormality of the edge data from two aspects: the unary outliers of the edge data itself and the multivariate parameter correlation among edge devices. The effectiveness of the application platform of the cyber-physical machine tool developed is verified by the prototype system and edge algorithm experiment.

    abstract = ""Digital twin is a virtual model that represents physical entities in a digital manner. By leveraging means of data to simulate the behavior of physical entities in the real environment, the functions of physical entities can be optimized and expanded, through virtual and real interaction feedback, data fusion, decision making, and optimization. Despite numerous researches on digital twin concept and its applications, scarcely any discusses about the computation efficiency of the twin established. In order to shorten the latency of mapping and reduce the high computation workload in the cloud, this paper develops a cyber-physical machine tool based on edge computing techniques, to realize remote sensing, real-time monitoring and scalable high-performance digital twin application. Furthermore, a novel edge computing algorithm is proposed to detect the abnormality of the edge data from two aspects: the unary outliers of the edge data itself and the multivariate parameter correlation among edge devices. The effectiveness of the application platform of the cyber-physical machine tool developed is verified by the prototype system and edge algorithm experiment.""

17	DTCPS	A low-cost, mobile real-time kinematic geolocation service for engineering and research applications	Centimetre accurate geolocation service is beneficial to a wide range of applications, ranging from sports engineering, civil infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, surveying to digitisation of historically significant structures. Previously, these features were confined to prohibitively expensive commercial hardware, requiring technical knowledge and experience to operate. Continued technological advancements have seen the miniaturisation of electronics and antennas, coupled with an increase in the number and performance of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) by various nations and organisations, providing global signal coverage. This paper demonstrates a low-cost, mobile, real-time kinematic (RTK) geolocation service for engineering and research applications, fabricated from components readily available from commercial suppliers. This solution, consisting of a mobile RTK base station and RTK rover, provides centimetre-accuracy performance up to a distance of 15 km away from the base station. Correction data is transmitted over the internet using free and open software solutions. The small footprint of both the RTK base station and RTK rover, provides versatile applications even in remote locations. The performance of the geolocation service is validated using field experiments, comparing measurements against state-of-the-art photogrammetry, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and digital level measurement technologies.

22	DTCPS	Full length ArticleA generic tri-model-based approach for product-level digital twin development in a smart manufacturing environment	Smart manufacturing, as an emerging manufacturing paradigm, leverages massive in-context data frommanufacturing systemsforintelligent decision makings. In such context, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a key role in digitizingmanufacturing systemsand integrating multiple systems together forcollaborative works. Amongst different levels of smartness and connectedness of CPS,Digital Twin(DT), as an exact digital copy of aphysical objector system including its properties and relationship with the environment, has a significant impact on realizing smart manufacturing. A DT constantly synchronizes with itsphysical systemand provides real-time high-fidelity simulations of the system and offers ubiquitous control over the system. Despite its great advantages, few works have been discussed about DT reference models, let alone a generic manner to establish it for smart manufacturing. Aiming to fill the gap, this research introduces a generic CPSsystem architecturefor DT establishment in smart manufacturing with a novel tri-model-based approach (i.e. digital model,computational modeland graph-based model) for product-level DT development. The tri-model works concurrently to simulate real-world physical behaviour and characteristics of the digital model. To validate the proposed architecture and approach, acase studyof an open source 3D printer DT establishment is further conducted. Conclusions and future works are also highlighted to provide insightful knowledge to both academia and industries at last.

27	DTCPS	Using finite element analysis to develop a digital twin of a manufacturing bending operation	In smart manufacturing, a digital twin is the virtual counterpart of a physical manufacturing system and can be considered as having three elements: machine, product and process. To demonstrate this concept, a physical manufacturing testbed was developed which bends metal into V-brackets alongside a digital twin counterpart consisting of the three elements. The process digital twin uses finite element modelling to predict product stress during the bending operation, and the residual stress and bend angle post-bending. The bend angles predicted by the process digital-twin were within 0.5deg and 3deg of the physical product for two different test scenarios.

28	DTCPS	Transfer learning as an enabler of the intelligent digital twin	Digital Twins have been described as beneficial in many areas, such as virtual commissioning, fault prediction or reconfiguration planning. Equipping Digital Twins with artificial intelligence functionalities can greatly expand those beneficial applications or open up altogether new areas of application, among them cross-phase industrial transfer learning. In the context of machine learning, transfer learning represents a set of approaches that enhance learning new tasks based upon previously acquired knowledge. Here, knowledge is transferred from one lifecycle phase to another in order to reduce the amount of data or time needed to train a machine learning algorithm.Looking at common challenges in developing and deploying industrial machinery with deep learning functionalities, embracing this concept would offer several advantages: Using an intelligent Digital Twin, learning algorithms can be designed, configured and tested in the design phase before the physical system exists and real data can be collected. Once real data becomes available, the algorithms must merely be fine-tuned, significantly speeding up commissioning and reducing the probability of costly modifications. Furthermore, using the Digital Twin's simulation capabilities virtually injecting rare faults in order to train an algorithm's response or using reinforcement learning, e.g. to teach a robot, become practically feasible.This article presents several cross-phase industrial transfer learning use cases utilizing intelligent Digital Twins. A real cyber physical production system consisting of an automated welding machine and an automated guided vehicle equipped with a robot arm is used to illustrate the respective benefits.

33	DTCPS	The FMS Training Center - a versatile learning environment for engineering education	Digital twins are created by combining a design model with the use phase data of a product or a system. They are developed in order to observe and test the behavior of the target over its life cycle. This paper introduces a versatile learning environment focusing on a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). The FMS Training center phenomenon based learning environment consists of a physical training system and its digital twin. The realization of the digital twin is a virtual model linked to a system simulator and an industrial controller. Students can thus become familiar with the fully automated production system and develop and test programs in a virtual environment before visiting the production facility. The digital twin also meets an industrial need as it facilitates virtual commissioning of new system installations. Evaluation of the benefits in educational context, and the largest obstacles, of developing system level digital twins are described. A full system description of the learning environment is presented with the pedagogical objectives of the associated exercises. Future development and extendibility of the learning environment are also discussed.

34	DTCPS	The Digital Twin as a Core Component for Industry 4.0 Smart Production Planning	Production systems that adhere the Industry 4.0 vision require new ways of control and integration of individual components, such as robots, transportation system shuttles or mobile platforms. This paper proposes a new production system control concept based on closing a feedback loop between a production planning system and a digital twin of the physical production system. The digital twin keeps up-to-date information about the current state of the physical production system and it is combined with the production planner utilizing artificial intelligence methods. Production recipes and concrete process instantiations are planned for each production order on-the-fly, based on the production system state retrieved form the digital twin. This approach provides a high flexibility in terms of ability to add and to remove products as well as production resources. It also enables error recovery by re-planning the production if some failure happens.

35	DTCPS	The Cyber-physical E-machine Manufacturing System: Virtual Engineering for Complete Lifecycle Support	Electric machines (e-machines) will form a fundamental part of the powertrain of the future. Automotive manufacturers are keen to develop e-machine manufacturing and assembly knowledge in-house. An on-going project, which aims to deliver an e-machine pilot assembly line, is being supported by a set of virtual engineering tools developed by the Automation Systems Group at the University of Warwick. Although digital models are a useful design aid providing visualization and simulation, the opportunity being exploited in this research paper is to have a common model throughout the lifecycle of both the manufacturing system and the product. The vision is to have a digital twin that is consistent with the real system and not just used in the early design and deployment phases. This concept, commonly referred to as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), is key to realizing efficient system reconfigurability to support alternative product volumes and mixes. These tools produce modular digital models that can be rapidly modified preventing the simulation, test, and modification processes forming a bottleneck to the development lifecycles. In addition, they add value at more mature phases when, for example, a high volume line based on the pilot is created as the same models can be reused and modified as required. This research paper therefore demonstrates how the application of the virtual engineering tools support the development of a CPS using an e-machine assembly station as a case study. The main contribution of the work is to further validate the CPS philosophy by extending the concept into practical applications in pilot production systems with prototype products.	digital manufacturing; virtual engineering; assembly automation; electric machines	SergeyKonstantinov; MussawarAhmad; KarthikAnanthanarayan; RobertHarrison	Procedia CIRP	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2017.02.035		119-124		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen	IC1: A least one testing technique is described		2	Science Direct	2017.0	The Cyber-physical E-machine Manufacturing System: Virtual Engineering for Complete Lifecycle Support	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2017.02.035	Science Direct	nan; References; Year; Bibtex

Modern approaches focus on strategic optimization via the concept of the Digital Twin. In this paper we present a model for the operational optimization of manufacturing systems via the core technology of the Digital Shadow. The model combines three main-aspects: automation, universality and the utilization of real-time data. Automation is achieved by a self-developed algorithm, universality by the application of a genetic algorithm and the integration of real-time-data through the utilization of the Digital Shadow. We validate the model by means of experimental-design.

38	DTCPS	Mbse testbed for rapid, cost-effective prototyping and evaluation of system modeling approaches	Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts. The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible frame-work to efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current testbed comprises several compo-nents, including a scenario builder, a smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios, connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system behavior.

39	DTCPS	Period adaptation of real-time control tasks with fixed-priority scheduling in cyber-physical systems	Long-lived, non-stop cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to evolutionary changes that can undermine the guarantees of schedulability that were verified at the time of deployment. At the same time, knowledge gleamed from extended periods of execution can be exploited to reduce the uncertainties that were inevitably presented in the system models that are used to define thetemporal behavioursof the control tasks. In this paper we utilise this knowledge and present an adaptation method that actively extends the period of control tasks at run-time based on historical measurements. This can lead tolower power consumptionor to the accommodation of increased computation resource demands from other components of the CPS. The method relies on online monitoring and model-based prediction to degrade control performance while having a minimal and acceptable impact on ongoing operations. Cloud-based computing is used to facilitate decision making and offload the local computation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through control-scheduling co-simulation.

40	DTCPS	Synchronizing Digital Process Twins between virtual products and resources - A virtual design method	Modern technologies, such as cyber-physical systems and the digital twin, are driving current developments in digital production and its virtual planning tools. Thus leads to specific need for consistent methods that can be used across projects, especially on the future production planning's long term view. Existing approaches deal with the cross-sectoral, virtually supported integration of cyber-physical properties in production structures by using multiple software structures. However, the potential of current production-related simulation tools in the field of systems virtual validation in the planning phase has not yet been exhausted. Based on this, the present work deals with a method for model data enrichment within virtual model-based systems development process that is executed in front of systems' virtual commissioning. The elaborated method presupposes the successful procurement of the necessary CAD data as geometrical information and is divided into four steps, starting from the analysis of the process parameters on the basis of the product to be produced. In the second step, a property determination of the existing and planned production structure is carried out. In order to transfer the findings to the virtual modeling process, the third step is to determine the modeling needs between the current state of production and the planned cyber-physical production. Finally, a data enrichment of the products and resources behavioral models takes place that causes possibility of the mutual production-technical influence for example, by synchronizing the process structure that is stored in virtual products and resources. The method is to be classified as a total consideration of products, processes and resources in simulation-based functional verification and physical property validation. In addition, the four steps will be verified, by using the automated car-underbody assembly demonstrator for the physical relief of workers in the final assembly area of   automobile production, including many variants.	virtual comissioning (VC); cyber-physical systems (CPS); simulation-based design method; digital tools	BenjaminIllmerab; MichaelVielhaberb	Procedia CIRP	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2019.04.227		532-537		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen	IC1: A least one testing technique is described		2	Science Direct	2019.0	Synchronizing digital process twins between virtual products and resources – A virtual design method	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2019.04.227	Science Direct	nan; References; Year; Bibtex

Nevertheless, there is still no context-aware testbed to support it. Digital twin, as an emerging concept empowered by the cutting-edge information and communication technology, has been widely adopted to realize smart product-service systems across many sectors. Owing to its advantages of high-fidelity simulation and cyber-physical interconnectivity, a generic digital twin-driven approach is proposed to support the in-context virtual prototyping and usage condition monitoring of complex product family. A case study of tower crane family design and optimization is further exploited to validate its cost-effectiveness.

43	DTCPS	Monitoring of vehicles' active safety systems in operation	This paper covers the results of monitoring active safety systems during vehicle operation.The analysis of the existing diagnostic methods for active safety systems in operation shows that on-board diagnostics of active safety systems does not cover the entire list of possible malfunctions.It is also worth considering that the electric drive systems of active safety systems are an integral part of the vehicle's braking system influencing traffic safety during operation.This issue can be resolved by supplementing the monitoring process with an additional diagnostics complex. This monitoring system receives data on the working processes of the vehicle automated systems' components in real time.An important difference from existing diagnostic systems is the ability to determine the exact malfunction of a vehicle's automated system component, as well as to establish the cause of the malfunction, allowing the system to reduce the possibility of a recurring malfunction and improve traffic safety.Coupled together with a data-sharing interface, this monitoring system enables the creation of the active vehicle's digital twin. We provide an example of how this simulation technology, based on a fusion of virtual and physical elements, helps study vehicle performance in complex, multi-factor operation modes.This diagnostic system, used in combination with a bench chassis model, makes it possible to adapt the system if the manufacturer adjusts the vehicle's automated system design, thereby simplifying the process of further verification of the digital twin.As automation grows more and more widespread, the use of such systems becomes more and more relevant.	diagnostics; monitoring; active safety system; digital twin; vehicle	VladislavDygaloa; AndreyKellerb; SergeyEvtiukovc	Transportation Research Procedia	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2020.10.014		113-120		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen	IC1: A least one testing technique is described		2	Science Direct	2020.0	Monitoring of vehicles' active safety systems in operation	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2020.10.014	Science Direct	nan; References; Year; Bibtex
44	DTCPS	Methodology to develop Digital Twins for energy efficient customizable IoT-Products	Products are increasingly individualized and enhanced to be able to communicate, e.g. via Industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, the impact of products on sustainability (environmental and social) across their life is often not considered and analyzed. IoT-based or smart products, that are able to communicate, generate data, which can be used to monitor and optimize sustainability indicators. The Digital Twin (DT) is a new technological concept which focuses on product individual data collection and analysis. It provides the possibility to make use of the available data and optimize the systems individual sustainability as well as future product generations. However, the design and realization of such a DT requires new approaches and capabilities, which is an identified research gap. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology to develop DTs of physical IoT-based products, the so called DT V-Model with the aim to optimize the systems sustainability, specifically environmental aspects. It is based on the V-model for the development of smart products and is enhanced with additional roles and approaches for DT development. The methodology is described in detail. The result of a development cycle according to the DT-V-Model is a tested concept of a DT, which includes Digital Master (DM) data from the planning phase and Digital Shadow (DS) data from the production, operation and End of Life-phase. For a DT for energy efficiency, the Digital Master model consists of the information and models from the product development phase including the planned production and use phase energy consumption. The Digital Shadow consists of the actual production energy consumption and the use phase energy consumption. The methodology is applied to a use case of an IoT-based consumer product that can be customized to a certain degree by the consumer. A DT is developed to monitor and optimize the products energy efficiency in production and use. The necessary elements of the DT and the capabilities are depicted. The paper shows the feasibility of the methodology for the development of DTs, the necessary adaptions to common approaches for development and the specific characteristics of DT development for the aim of energy efficiency.

46	DTCPS	Comparing ontologies and databases: a critical review of lifecycle engineering models in manufacturing	The literature on the modeling and management of data generated through the lifecycle of a manufacturing system is split into two main paradigms: product lifecycle management (PLM) and product, process, resource (PPR) modeling. These paradigms are complementary, and the latter could be considered a more neutral version of the former. There are two main technologies associated with these paradigms: ontologies and databases. Database technology is widespread in industry and is well established. Ontologies remain largely a plaything of the academic community which, despite numerous projects and publications, have seen limited implementations in industrial manufacturing applications. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between ontologies and databases, offering both qualitative and quantitative analyses in the context of PLM and PPR. To achieve this, the article presents (1) a literature review within the context of manufacturing systems that use databases and ontologies, identifying their respective strengths and weaknesses, and (2) an implementation in a real industrial scenario that demonstrates how different modeling approaches can be used for the same purpose. This experiment is used to enable discussion and comparative analysis of both modeling strategies.

    abstract = ""The literature on the modeling and management of data generated through the lifecycle of a manufacturing system is split into two main paradigms: product lifecycle management (PLM) and product, process, resource (PPR) modeling. These paradigms are complementary, and the latter could be considered a more neutral version of the former. There are two main technologies associated with these paradigms: ontologies and databases. Database technology is widespread in industry and is well established. Ontologies remain largely a plaything of the academic community which, despite numerous projects and publications, have seen limited implementations in industrial manufacturing applications. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between ontologies and databases, offering both qualitative and quantitative analyses in the context of PLM and PPR. To achieve this, the article presents (1) a literature review within the context of manufacturing systems that use databases and ontologies, identifying their respective strengths and weaknesses, and (2) an implementation in a real industrial scenario that demonstrates how different modeling approaches can be used for the same purpose. This experiment is used to enable discussion and comparative analysis of both modeling strategies. (c) 2021, The Author(s)."",

48	DTCPS	Ensuring consistency in scalable-detail models for DT-based control	Digital Twins (DTs for short) are a powerful aid for creating, assessing and maintaining control strategies. This use of DTs however requires that the physical entities to control be described at different levels of detail. For example, simple I/O models are used to compute parameters of modulating controllers, more time-accurate ones may be required to set up and assess logic controls, high-accuracy, possibly nonlinear ones may serve for overall strategy verification, and for software-in-the-loop testing, also the host computing/network architecture needs representing. In such a complex scenario, guaranteeing that all the descriptions of all elements are consistent with one another is a relevant problem. We discuss this matter and propose a solution, in the form of a modelling paradigm where as a novel contributions relationships (in a sense analogous to what the term means in database theory) can be instated and enforced. This allows to create and maintain knowledge based made of interrelate data and models, embracing all the major DT interpretations proposed so far in the literature, or said more explicitly, combining data-driven and model-driven DTs in a single framework. We also provide an illustrative example.

49	DTCPS	Digital twins of human robot collaboration in a production setting	This paper aims to present a digital twin framework to support the design, build and control of human-machine cooperation. In this study, computer simulations are used to develop a digital counterpart of a human-robot collaborative work environment for assembly work. The digital counterpart remains updated during the life cycle of the production system by continuously mirroring the physical system for quick and safe embed for continuous improvements. The case of a manufacturing company with human-robot work teams is presented for developing and validating the digital twin framework.

50	DTCPS	Enhancement of human-centered workplace design and optimization with Exoskeleton technology	The employment of intelligent tools in production, such as the new area of wearable robotics, the Exoskeletons, represents valuable and promising technology to reduce the physical stress and increase innovation, productivity and workplace safety. The challenge of realizing these advanced manufacturing environments with integrated Exoskeletons is represented by missing design and planning methods required to equip future workplaces with this enabling technology. The integration of Exoskeletons in logistics and production activities creates a new hybrid type of workstation that has to be designed according to a scientific approach. The article presents the first steps in developing an innovative approach to planning and optimizing intelligent working environments with integrated adaptive Exoskeletons. The topic harmonizes three main areas of research: a) production technologies and holistic planning of production processes; b) ergonomics, safety and security of workers in production environments and c) configuration based on the components of the new type of wearable robotics, the Exoskeletons.The validation of this approach is provided through the creation of digital human/Exoskeleton models combining digital Exoskeleton with various digital human models. The Digital Twin of the human/Exoskeleton system is the heart of a holistic design and optimization process that aims to assess the appropriateness of the selected Exoskeleton by simulating the tasks performed and adapting the simulation parameters.An exemplary validation case in one of the most innovative and dynamic sector, the construction sector, demonstrates the applicability of the model. A guideline for migrate the model in other industry sectors is provided, as well.

51	DTCPS	LettersDigital twin - Proof of concept	Miniaturization and price decline enable the integration of information, communication and sensor technologies into virtually any product. Products become able to sense their own state as well as the state of their environment. Paired with the ability to process and communicate this data allows for the creation of digital twins. The digital twin is a comprehensive digital representation of an individual product that will play an integral role in a fully digitalized product life cycle. To prove the digital twin concept a cyber-physicalbending beam testbench was developed at DiK research lab.

While OMA-based Structural Health Monitoring  methods using statistical pattern recognition are known to allow the detection of small structural damages due to earthquakes, even far-field ones of moderate intensity, the combination of SM and IDA-based methods for damage localization and quantification is here proposed. The monumental bell tower of the Basilica of San Pietro located in Perugia, Italy, is considered for the validation of the method. While being continuously monitored since 2014, the bell tower experienced the main shocks of the 2016 Central Italy seismic sequence and the on-site vibration-based monitoring system detected changes in global dynamic behavior after the earthquakes. In the paper, experimental vibration data (continuous and seismic records), FE models and surrogate models of the structure are used for post-earthquake damage localization and quantification exploiting an ideal subdivision of the structure into meaningful macroelements. Results of linear and non-linear numerical modeling (SM and IDA, respectively) are successfully combined to this aim and the continuous exchange of information between the physical reality (monitoring data) and the virtual models (FE models and surrogate models) effectively enforces the Digital Twin paradigm. The earthquake-induced damage identified by both data-driven and model-based strategies is finally confirmed by in-situ visual inspections.

54	DTCPS	Cyber-physical-system for representing a robot end effector	Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is a method to program robots through the performance of a task by humans. Most implementations are online methods that use visual or force feedback of the demonstrator. However, we developed an offline programming approach for PbD with a special input device within an Augmented Reality Environment. Therefore, this paper aims to answer how the characteristics and functionality of the end effector of a jointed-arm robot can be represented by a haptic input device in order to perform PbD. The PbD process is first carried out on a digital twin of the robot, visualized to the user in real physical space by means of augmented reality technology. The programming of the digital twin can later be transferred to the real robot. The haptic input device in this context is the main part of the Cyber-Physical-System (CPS), which enables the user to interact with the virtual robot. Therefore, the specification of the mechanical and software components of the CPS is of main importance. Within this paper, strategies for the implementation of shape and function abstraction, as well as for ensuring communication, have been worked out. The physical shape of the CPS is kept generic and is only subject to ergonomic restrictions. However, Augmented Reality overlays the physical shape with an exact digital image of the end effector used later in the process. Nevertheless, the physical characteristics of the real robot should be represented as real as possible by the CPS. Therefore, the CPS is equipped with various sensors and actuators. With the CPS it is possible to determine contact forces and to manipulate objects to a certain extent in order to teach gripping strategies to the digital twin. An operating system was developed for communication and control of the electronic components. For the validation of the functionality of the CPS an exemplary PbD process was developed, the results were analyzed and evaluated.	industrial robot; cyber physical system; programming by demonstration, digital twin; augmented reality	FabianMullera; ChristianDeuerleina; MichaelKocha	Procedia CIRP	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2021.05.071		307-312		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen	IC1: A least one testing technique is described		2	Science Direct	2021.0	Cyber-physical-system for representing a robot end effector	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2021.05.071	Science Direct	nan; References; Year; Bibtex
55	DTCPS	Digital twin-driven carbon emission prediction and low-carbon control of intelligent manufacturing job-shop	Along with the development of sensing and data processing technology, intelligence manufacturing based on cyber physical system (CPS) is a development tendency of manufacturing industry. And digital twin has been regarded as an implement method of CPS. Considering the complexity and uncertainty of discrete manufacturing job-shop, the carbon emission data integration and low-carbon control of the manufacturing systems automatically are two significant challenges. In order to realize the carbon emission reduction in intelligent manufacturing workshop, a digital twin-driven carbon emission prediction and low-carbon control of intelligent manufacturing job-shop is proposed, which includes digital twin model of low-carbon manufacturing job-shop, digital twin data interaction and fusion for low-carbon manufacturing, digital twin-driven carbon emission prediction and low-carbon control. And three key enabling technologies are also studied, i.e., digital twin data processing of low-carbon manufacturing job-shop, carbon emission evaluation and prediction service based on digital twin, digital twin data-driven low-carbon control methods of manufacturing job-shop. This method can integrate the latest information and computing technology with low-carbon manufacturing, and verify and optimize the control schemes through virtual workshop. Meanwhile, the carbon emission evaluation and prediction can be encapsulated into a service of a machine tool for customers.

56	DTCPS	Combined development and test of product-service systems in early product development stages for customized, availability-oriented business models in the capital goods industry	Availability-Oriented Product-Service Systems (AOPSS) give manufacturers of capital goods the opportunity to expand their offerings while fulfilling the customers' needs for product availability. In turn, they generate special requirements for the early product development phase. Condition monitoring has to be taken into account, which results in a contradiction since learning-based condition monitoring approaches require large amounts of data which isn't available in that particular stage. Techniques from model-based systems engineering allow solving problems newly arising when developing parts or products in AOPSS. The approach proposed in the paper is being illustrated based on a use case from the agricultural industry.

57	DTCPS	Business Models for Industrial Smart Services - The Example of a Digital Twin for a Product-Service-System for Potato Harvesting	Modern agricultural machinery manufacturers develop an increasing number of smart services to combine their already excellent physical products with an ever-growing number of physical and digital services to product-service-systems. However, this causes problems for the manufacturers, as these combinations of physical goods, services and digital services are still relatively new, and suitable business models are lacking. This paper presents a morphological framework based on a literature review and expert interviews to develop business models for product service systems. Based on the morphological framework, six different types of general business models for smart services were identified and will be described. The types were validated within the German-based research project Smart-Farming-World along with experts from agriculture and farmers. This paper discusses the first results of the validation with farmers and shows the potential of a business model for a digital twin in the context of potato harvesting.

58	DTCPS	A Reconfigurable Modeling Approach for Digital Twin-based Manufacturing System	The emergence of digital twin enables real-time interaction and integration between the physical world and the information world. Digital twin-based manufacturing systems, as a typical representative of smart manufacturing, have a set of advantages beyond the traditional ones, such as verifying and predicting the manufacturing system performance based on the operation of a virtual one. This paper presents a five-dimensional digital twin modeling approach for manufacturing systems, which can not only realize the mapping between the physical and virtual twins, but also some of the capabilities and dependencies of the digital twins can be derived. A reconfigurable strategy, based on the expandable model structure and the reserved interfaces of objective functions and optimization algorithms, is proposed to make the digital twin-based manufacturing system satisfy the various reconfigurable requirements of different granularities and targets. Finally, a prototype system is developed to demonstrate the performance of the reconfigurable digital twin-based manufacturing system, which can improve the operation efficiency of such systems for carrying out the reconfiguring production tasks.

59	DTCPS	Automated Digital Twins Generation for Manufacturing Systems: a Case Study	The recent industrial scenario was defined by the emergence of digital twins and cyber physical systems as key elements for manufacturers leadership. Digital models can perform good in terms of production planning and control decisions if they are correctly representing their physical counterparts at anytime. Discrete event simulation can be considered as established digital models of manufacturing system, thanks to the proven capabilities of correctly estimating the system performances. Automated simulation model generation techniques can significantly reduce model development phases and allow for using simulation models for short term decisions in production. Application studies and test cases are scarce in the literature. In this paper, we present the application of a digital model generation method. The test case is done exploiting a lab-scale model of a manufacturing system composed by six stations. We investigate how the model generation works online, during the transient phase of a manufacturing system. Results confirm the real-time applicability of the approach provided that sufficient data points are available from the production event logs.

60	DTCPS	A digital twin strategy for major failure detection in fused deposition modeling processes	Part distortion during additive manufacturing (AM) may lead to catastrophic failure and significant waste of resources. Existing work often focuses on identification and detection of individual root causes such as melt pool geometries or extruder clogging to prevent part failures. Since the end-effect of major print failures can be the result of multiple error sources (including unknowns), relying on detection of individual root causes may misclassify some failed prints as successful. Instead, detecting end-effects or part distortion could provide early warning of major failures regardless of potential error sources. Distortion detection, however, currently involves computationally expensive simulation and analysis of sensing data. One promising solution is to adopt digital twin strategy to quickly compare model prediction to features extracted from in situ sensing data. This study extends the digital twin strategy to major distortion detection by developing (1) a multi-view optical sensing system for movable print beds and (2) failure detection methods by analyzing multi-view of part images layer by layer. Since the digital twin of actual prints at specific layers are generated offline, delay can be reduced to determine if a significant enough quality departure has occurred to justify termination of the print. In the experimental evaluation of this approach for a FDM machine with a moving print bed, failure was rapidly detected in two of the three test prints, while in the remaining print, failure was successfully detected after a short delay.

61	DTCPS	A New Modeling Approach for Power Grid Online Analysis	A new modeling approach for power grid online analysis is proposed to support the realization of a new online analysis system architecture. The model-driven software development, automatic code generation, and in-memory computing techniques are employed in the modeling approach. Data source adapters are developed for the integration of the model with the existing EMS system. A large-scale power grid online network data model (~40K-bus) is used for the model performance testing in a Lab environment. The proposed modeling approach was used to develop a new online analysis application, which was deployed and running in a provincial grid dispatching control center. The Lab and field performance measurement shows that the modeling approach-based application can achieve second-order end-to-end responsiveness.

62	DTCPS	A Digital Twin for Integrated Inspection System in Digital Manufacturing	Coordinate metrology is a crucial part in advanced manufacturing industries to achieve and maintain conformance of high-quality products within design specifications. Meanwhile, software-components are increasingly becoming an essential part of the inspection process because of increasing part complexities in design and the high-volume of data captured from different sensors in hardware-components. This paper presents avirtual replicato work parallel to an integrated inspection system (IIS) for inspection of freeform and complex surfaces based on a metric of their geometric complexity. In this approach, an intelligently guided sampling is virtually conducted from a large dataset, instead of the physical sampling process when the sample points are traditionally selected randomly from the measured surface. Implementation of a closed-loop between the main tasks in IIS is considered in developing this digital twin to reduce the uncertainties associated with the inspection process. A method is introduced to estimate the local densities of the measured points required for virtual sampling from each patch on the work-pieces's surface based on its geometric complexity. Two case studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the methodology. The observed efficiency in selection of the important measured data in the proposed sampling strategy makes it a better sampling strategy to be implemented in a digital twin for IISs.

63	DTCPS	AI-Powered Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems in Defence Transformation. Impact and Challenges	Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are changing business, and transforming defense and warfare. In particular, the paper addresses the challenges from the easy availability of AI resources to be applied to drones that are already an asymmetric threat, and the issues concerning theLethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS)that promise military advantages like the reduction of deployed soldiers, loss of civilians, damage of infrastructures, and the rapid support to decision-making. Autonomous systems can also help in disaster and humanitarian operations. However, the deployment of systems that are more and more autonomous from humans poses multidimensional challenges for their certification, compliance with ethics and international humanitarian law and present risks to security. Mechanisms for the mitigation of their proliferation to malicious non-state actors and ameaningful human controlshould be implemented. War gaming in a theoretical, risk-safe environment can assess the threats and impact of robotic weapons on future defense planning and operations. From the example of the lessons learned in the automotive industry, simulation can be applied to digital twin models of the AI system and the environment to train and test under unexpected and extreme conditions, unanticipated hardware and software failure situations and in complex dynamic operational contexts including interaction with civilian entities.

64	DTCPS	A Hybrid Control Architecture for an Automated Storage and Retrieval System	An automated retrieval and storage system, or ASRS, is a system that handles automatically the replenishment, picking, and delivery of products of a warehouse system. The current trend of ASRS is to develop less-rigid structures and continuous operations to improve the functionality, efficiency, and reactivity during its operation. However, the dynamic market changes and internal perturbations are characteristics that need to be handled by the ASRS control system to ensure the expected flexibility. The objective of this paper is two-fold. First, it proposes a framework of an ASRS control system, based on a hybrid control architecture that provides efficient operation during normal functioning and reactivity features in case of perturbations. Second, for validation purpose, a platform is constructed that simulates the virtual and physical level of the control system by means of a digital twin that represents the products and the resources composing the ASRS.

65	DTCPS	A digital twin emulator of a modular production system using a data-driven hybrid modeling and simulation approach	Virtual commissioning is a key technology in Industry 4.0 that can address issues faced by engineers during early design phases. The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin--a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms. The Digital Twin Emulator can support design decisions, test what-if system configurations, verify and validate the actual behavior of the complete system off-line, test realistic reactions, and provide statistics on the system's performance.

66	DTCPS	A Benchmarking Platform for Human-Machine Cooperation in Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems	The research community is producing a tremendous amount of works with the sole purpose to prepare for the next industrial revolution. In the context of the development of cyber-physical systems to production systems, a variety of technologies and architectures integrating humans and machines are studied. Results are evaluated using platforms to identify the best solutions. However, most platforms are designed to test one approach in a specific domain and the human integration remains difficult to evaluate. As the cooperation aspect between Humans and machines becomes of an increasing concern, a global benchmarking platform becomes necessary. Such a platform is specified in this paper. An illustration is detailed, based on the concept of digital twin.

67	DTCPS	Simulation of compensated tool path through virtual robot machining model	Nowadays, industrial robots could be a successful alternative to machine tools for milling of large parts with complex geometry. As it is known, poor accuracy which is most influenced by the stiffness of robot structure is recognized as a limiting factor for successful use of robots in milling tasks. Since there are different sources of error in robots, virtual manufacturing systems provide a useful means for products to be manufactured without the need of physical testing on the shop floor. This paper presents the developed virtual robot machining model, as a part of digital twin, for the simulation of a modified tool path generated by the compensation algorithm for the errors induced by cutting forces due to robot compliance. This part of digital twin includes the robot kinematic model, the Cartesian space robot compliance model, the model of cutting forces and the developed program based on off-line compensation algorithm. Development of such virtual robot machining model is important for the validation of modified tool path before the machining on a real robot. The developed virtual robot machining model is verified via several experiments, where the simulated surfaces are compared with the real machined surfaces generated by tool movement through a modified, i.e., corrected, trajectory on an available industrial robot programmed in G-code.

68	DTCPS	Torque-based temperature control in friction stir welding by using a digital twin	Friction stir welding (FSW) is an innovative solid-state welding technology that produces high quality joints and is widely used in the aerospace industry. Previous studies have revealed welding temperature to be a decisive factor for joint quality. Consequently, several temperature control systems for FSW have been developed. These output feedback control systems usually require delicate and expensive temperature measuring equipment, which reduces their suitability for industrial practice. This paper presents a novel state feedback system of the welding temperature to remedy this shortcoming. The system uses a physical model of the FSW process (digital twin) for the determination of the welding temperature signal from the process torque signal. The digital twin is based on a multi-input nonlinear time invariant model, which is fed with the torque signal from the spindle motor. A model-based L1 adaptive controller was employed for its robustness with respect to model inaccuracies and fast adaption to fluctuations in the controlled system. The experimental validation of the feedback control system showed improved weld quality compared to welded joints produced without temperature control. The achieved control accuracies depended on the results of the temperature calculation. Control deviations of less than 10 K could be achieved for certain welding parameters, and even for a work piece geometry, which deliberately caused heat accumulation.

70	DTCPS	Resource-efficient sensor data management for autonomous systems using deep reinforcement learning	"Hyperconnectivity via modern Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has recently driven us to envision ""digital twin"", in which physical attributes are all embedded, and their latest updates are synchronized on digital spaces in a timely fashion. From the point of view of cyberphysical system (CPS) architectures, the goals of digital twin include providing common programming abstraction on the same level of databases, thereby facilitating seamless integration of real-world physical objects and digital assets at several different system layers. However, the inherent limitations of sampling and observing physical attributes often pose issues related to data uncertainty in practice. In this paper, we propose a learning-based data management scheme where the implementation is layered between sensors attached to physical attributes and domain-specific applications, thereby mitigating the data uncertainty between them. To do so, we present a sensor data management framework, namely D2WIN, which adopts reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to manage the data quality for CPS applications and autonomous systems. To deal with the scale issue incurred by many physical attributes and sensor streams when adopting RL, we propose an action embedding strategy that exploits their distance-based similarity in the physical space coordination. We introduce two embedding methods, i.e., a user-defined function and a generative model, for different conditions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the D2WIN framework with the action embedding outperforms several known heuristics in terms of achievable data quality under certain resource restrictions. We also test the framework with an autonomous driving simulator, clearly showing its benefit. For example, with only 30% of updates selectively applied by the learned policy, the driving agent maintains its performance about 96.2%, as compared to the ideal condition with full updates."

71	DTCPS	Multi-Domain modelling of LEDs for supporting virtual prototyping of luminaires	This paper presents our approaches to chip level multi-domain LED (light emitting diode) modelling, targeting luminaire design in the Industry 4.0 era, to support virtual prototyping of LED luminaires through luminaire level multi-domain simulations. The primary goal of such virtual prototypes is to predict the light output characteristics of LED luminaires under different operating conditions. The key component in such digital twins of a luminaire is an appropriate multi-domain model for packaged LED devices that captures the electrical, thermal, and light output characteristics and their mutual dependence simultaneously and consistently. We developed two such models with this goal in mind that are presented in detail in this paper. The first model is a semi analytical, quasi black-box model that can be implemented on the basis of the built-in diode models of spice-like circuit simulators and a few added controlled sources. Our second presented model is derived from the physics of the operation of today's power LEDs realized with multiple quantum well heterojunction structures. Both models have been implemented in the form of visual basic macros as well as circuit models suitable for usual spice circuit simulators. The primary test bench for the two circuit models was an LTspice simulation environment. Then, to support the design of different demonstrator luminaires of the Delphi4LED project, a spreadsheet application was developed, which ensured seamless integration of the two models with additional models representing the LED chips' thermal environment in a luminaire. The usability of our proposed models is demonstrated by real design case studies during which simulated light output characteristics (such as hot lumens) were confirmed by luminaire level physical tests.

72	DTCPS	Real-time vision-based multiple object tracking of a production process: Industrial digital twin case study	The adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies within the manufacturing and process industries is widely accepted to have benefits for production cycles, increase system flexibility and give production managers more options on the production line through reconfigurable systems. A key enabler in Industry 4.0 technology is the rise in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Digital Twins (DTs). Both technologies connect the physical to the cyber world in order to generate smart manufacturing capabilities. State of the art research accurately describes the frameworks, challenges and advantages surrounding these technologies but fails to deliver on testbeds and case studies that can be used for development and validation. This research demonstrates a novel proof of concept Industry 4.0 production system which lays the foundations for future research in DT technologies, process optimisation and manufacturing data analytics. Using a connected system of commercial off-the-shelf cameras to retrofit a standard programmable logic controlled production process, a digital simulation is updated in real time to create the DT. The system can identify and accurately track the product through the production cycle whilst updating the DT in real-time.

In the past, virtual coordinate measuring machines have been extensively researched. Research on digital twins of optical systems is still lacking due to the high number of error contributors. A method to describe a digital twin of an optical measurement system is presented in this article. The discussed optical system is a laser line scanner mounted on a coordinate measuring machine. Each component of the measurement system is mathematically described. The coordinate measuring machine focuses on the hardware errors and the laser line scanner determines the measurement error based on the scan depth, in-plane angle and out-of-plane angle. The digital twin assumes stable measurement conditions and uniform surface characteristics. Based on the Monte Carlo principle, virtual measurements can be used to determine the measurement uncertainty. This is demonstrated by validating the digital twin on a set of calibrated ring gauges. Two validation tests are performed: the first verifies the virtual uncertainty estimation by comparison with experimental data. The second validates the measured diameter of different ring gauges by comparing the estimated confidence interval with the calibrated diameter.	digital twin; laser line scanner; coordinate measuring machine; digital twin;  laser line scanner;  coordinate measuring machine	Vlaeyen, Michiel; Haitjema, Han; Dewulf, Wim	SENSORS	https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196638			"""@article{WOS:000708274100001,

74	DTCPS	Preparing Datasets of Surface Roughness for Constructing Big Data from the Context of Smart Manufacturing and Cognitive Computing	In smart manufacturing, human-cyber-physical systems host digital twins and IoT-based networks. The networks weave manufacturing enablers such as CNC machine tools, robots, CAD/CAM systems, process planning systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and human resources. The twins work as the brains of the enablers; that is, the twins supply the required knowledge and help enablers solve problems autonomously in real-time. Since surface roughness is a major concern of all manufacturing processes, twins to solve surface roughness-relevant problems are needed. The twins must machine-learn the required knowledge from the relevant datasets available in big data. Therefore, preparing surface roughness-relevant datasets to be included in the human-cyber-physical system-friendly big data is a critical issue. However, preparing such datasets is a challenge due to the lack of a steadfast procedure. This study sheds some light on this issue. A state-of-the-art method is proposed to prepare the said datasets for surface roughness, wherein each dataset consists of four segments: semantic annotation, roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system. These segments provide input information for digital twins' input, modeling, simulation, and validation modules. The semantic annotation segment boils down to a concept map. A human- and machine-readable concept map is thus developed where the information of other segments (roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system) is integrated. The delay map of surface roughness profile heights plays a pivotal role in the proposed dataset preparation method. The successful preparation of datasets of surface roughness underlying milling, turning, grinding, electric discharge machining, and polishing shows the efficacy of the proposed method. The method will be extended to the manufacturing processes in the next phase of this study.	big data; surface roughness; digital twin; human-cyber-physical system; artificial intelligence; big data;  surface roughness;  digital twin;  human-cyber-physical system;  artificial intelligence	Fattahi, Saman; Okamoto, Takuya; Ura, Sharifu	BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING	https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc5040058		58	"""@article{WOS:000736266400001,

75	DTCPS	Experimental characterization of H-VAWT turbine for development of a digital twin	A digital twin can be described as a digital replica of a physical asset. The use of such models is key to understanding complex loading phenomena experienced during testing of vertical axis wind turbines. Unsteady aerodynamic and structural effects such as dynamic stall and dynamically changing thrust and blade loading are difficult to predict with certainty. This leads to inefficient turbine designs or worse yet premature failures. Many of these phenomena can be better understood through scaled wind tunnel testing. The analysis of these test results is greatly improved by having a well calibrated digital twin model of the turbine. This paper discusses the methodologies used in the development of the model for a H style vertical axis wind turbine. This includes physical measurements of the as built system, updates to the models based upon experimental testing and a final correlation between test and model on a component by component as well as fully assembled system.

76	DTCPS	Employing finite element analysis and robust control concepts in mechatronic system design-flexible manipulator case study	The paper deals with development of a methodology for mechatronic system design using state-of-the-art model-based system engineering methods. A simple flexible robotic arm is considered as a benchmark problem for the evaluation of various techniques used in the phases of modelling, analysis, control system design, validation, and implementation. The flexible nature of the mechanical structure introduces inherently oscillatory dynamics in the target bandwidth range, which complicates all the above-mentioned design steps. This paper demonstrates the process of deriving a complex nonlinear model of the flexible arm setup. An initial idea about the plant dynamics is acquired from analytical modelling using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. A more thorough understanding is subsequently acquired from finite element analysis. Linearisation and order reduction are the next steps necessary for the derivation of a simplified control-relevant model. A time-dependent variable parameter of load mass position is considered and a robust controller is subsequently designed in order to fulfil certain performance criteria for all the admissible plant configurations. This is performed using a recent H-infinity loop shaping method for fixed structure controller design. The results are validated by means of a physical plant, comparing the experimental data with the model predictions.

77	DTCPS	Machining Phenomenon Twin Construction for Industry 4.0: A Case of Surface Roughness	Industry 4.0 requires phenomenon twins to functionalize the relevant systems (e.g., cyber-physical systems). A phenomenon twin means a computable virtual abstraction of a real phenomenon. In order to systematize the construction process of a phenomenon twin, this study proposes a system defined as the phenomenon twin construction system. It consists of three components, namely the input, processing, and output components. Among these components, the processing component is the most critical one that digitally models, simulates, and validates a given phenomenon extracting information from the input component. What kind of modeling, simulation, and validation approaches should be used while constructing the processing component for a given phenomenon is a research question. This study answers this question using the case of surface roughness-a complex phenomenon associated with all material removal processes. Accordingly, this study shows that for modeling the surface roughness of a machined surface, the approach called semantic modeling is more e ffective than the conventional approach called the Markov chain. It is also found that to validate whether or not a simulated surface roughness resembles the expected roughness, the outcomes of the possibility distribution-based computing and DNA-based computing are more effective than the outcomes of a conventional computing wherein the arithmetic mean height of surface roughness is calculated. Thus, apart from the conventional computing approaches, the leading edge computational intelligence-based approaches can digitize manufacturing processes more effectively.

78	DTCPS	Dynamic safety measurement-control technology for intelligent connected vehicles based on digital twin system	As the number of connected vehicles increases, the intelligence levels become more and more uneven, so the problem how to determine the dynamic safety of autonomous driving behavior in the mixed-flow traffic system is significantly increased. To solve many difficult problems related to human-vehicle-road perception, decision, control coordination, and reliability evaluation in the intelligent networked scenario, this study establishes a dynamic Game model with multi-source information in the intelligent networked environment, to carry out the measurements and control evaluations for autonomous vehicle dynamics models, forward and backward active safety control, and mixed traffic trajectory optimization planning based on the optimal solution strategy. A digital twin test verification platform with semi-physical environment and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation to control the accuracy for making dynamic safety decision for the intelligent networked vehicle is developed by combining with the V2X real intelligent transportation system and smart laboratory virtual simulation test technology, which realizes the complex and dynamic safety decision goals for autonomous vehicle in different connected levels of the mixed-flow traffic environments, such as multi-agent perception, multi-source information transmission, vehicle control, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and vehicle-to-road coordination. The study is conducive to improving the test efficiency and index evaluation integrity of the intelligent networked system, reducing the test costs, proving the behaviors of Game interaction and stress safety response under vehicle-to-road environment, enhancing the robustness and applicability of automatic driving technology, and improving the traffic efficiency and safety of mixed-flow traffic in the intelligent network.

79	DTCPS	Design and implementation of a Smart IoT based building and town disaster management system in Smart City Infrastructure	Recently, fire accidents in buildings have become bigger around the world, and it has become necessary to build an efficient building disaster management system suitable for fires in a Smart City. As building fires increase the number of casualties and property damage, it is necessary to take appropriate action accordingly. There has been an increasing effort to develop such disaster management systems worldwide by applying information communication technology (ICT), and many studies have been conducted in practice. In this paper, an augmented reality (AR)-based Smart Building and Town Disaster Management System is suggested in order to acquire visibility and to grasp occupants in case of fire disasters in buildings. This system provides visualization information and optimal guide for quick initial response by utilizing smart element AR-based disaster management service through linkage of physical virtual domain in the building. Additionally, we show a scenario flow chart of the fire extinguishment process according to the time from the ignition stage to the extinguishment stage in the building. Finally, we introduce the related sensors, the actuators, and a small test-bed for AR-based disaster management service. This test-bed was designed for interlocking and interoperability test of the system between the sensors and the actuators. It is expected that the proposed system can provide a quick and safe rescue guideline to the occupants and rescuers in the building where fire is generated and in regions of poor visibility.

80	DTCPS	Domain adaptation digital twin for rolling element bearing prognostics	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is escalating in data-driven condition monitoring research. Traditional expert knowledgebased Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) processes can be smartened up with the assistance of various AI techniques, such as deep learning models. On the other hand, current deep learning based prognostics suffers from the data deficit issue, especially considering the varying operating conditions and the degradation modes of the components in practical industrial applications. With the development of simulation techniques, physical-knowledge based digital twin models give engineers access to a large amount of simulation data at a lower cost. These simulation data contain the physical characteristics and the degradation information of the component. In order to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) during the degradation process, in this paper, a bearing digital twin model is constructed based on a phenomenological vibration model. A Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) is used to achieve the domain adaptation target between the simulation and the real data. Regarding the simulation data as the source domain and the real data as the target domain, the DANN model is able to predict the RUL without any priori knowledge of the labelling information. Based on the validation results from real bearing run-to-failure experiments, the proposed method is able to get the minimum RUL prediction error compared against state-of-the-art methods.

81	DTCPS	Digital twin system for highway traffic based on 3D GIS technology	Digital twin is the science that integrates multidisciplinary attributes and achieves the interaction and integration of virtual and reality through the fusion of physical world and information world. Digital twin has been applied in the transportation industry through BIM+GIS technology. The interaction of various transportation infrastructure model elements and the rational construction of twin data have become the bottleneck restricting its development. In the 3D GIS environment, with the guidance of digitally-generated five-dimensional structural model, a specific implementation technique for geometric, physical, and regular models that the virtual model should contain was proposed. The classification of transportation infrastructure and the characteristics of twin data were analyzed. Then, the layer relationship of its components was refined and the scheme of identification coding and storage of models was implemented. Furthermore, the system software was classified according to CAMP5, and the verification method was explained according to each layer to complete the system verification. Based on the virtual model and data fusion, the ideas of application development of pixel layer, representation layer and decision layer were combed, which could provide technical references for achieving digital twin in the traffic field.

82	DTCPS	Digital twin modeling of a solar car based on the hybrid model method with data-driven and mechanistic	Solar cars are energy-sensitive and affected by many factors. In order to achieve optimal energy management of solar cars, it is necessary to comprehensively characterize the energy flow of vehicular components. To model these components which are hard to formulate, this study stim-ulates a solar car with the digital twin (DT) technology to accurately characterize energy. Based on the hybrid modeling approach combining mechanistic and data-driven technologies, the DT model of a solar car is established with a designed cloud platform server based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to realize data interaction between physical and virtual entities. The DT model is further modified by the offline optimization data of drive motors, and the energy consumption is evaluated with the DT system in the real-world experiment. Specifically, the energy consumption error between the experiment and simulation is less than 5.17%, which suggests that the established DT model can accurately stimulate energy consumption.

83	DTCPS	Design and Implementation of Runtime Verification Framework for Cyber-Physical Production Systems	Traditional factories are turning into smart factories with the advent of various ICT technologies, and various control decisions are derived by AI technologies. In this circumstance, runtime verification of a control command is important for zero-defect manufacturing processes but challengeable because factories of the future are highly complex and heterogeneous systems. In this paper, we propose DigTwinOps, a Digital Twin framework for Runtime Verification of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). DigTwinOps features a Digital Twin Execution Engine (DTEE) that manages a Digital Twin Model to synchronize states of a real CPPS object in a production environment. With a monitoring and simulation combination process, a human worker can observe the states of the CPPS object and verify the effectiveness of control commands before applying it to a real production environment. The proposed framework is applied to a CPPS prototype production system, and the results show that the framework can work effectively in the controllability verification of control commands.

84	DTCPS	Design and Implementation of Universal Cyber-Physical Model for Testing Logistic Control Algorithms of Production Line's Digital Twin by Using Color Sensor	This paper deals with the design and implementation of a universal cyber-physical model capable of simulating any production process in order to optimize its logistics systems. The basic idea is the direct possibility of testing and debugging advanced logistics algorithms using a digital twin outside the production line. Since the digital twin requires a physical connection to a real line for its operation, this connection is substituted by a modular cyber-physical system (CPS), which replicates the same physical inputs and outputs as a real production line. Especially in fully functional production facilities, there is a trend towards optimizing logistics systems in order to increase efficiency and reduce idle time. Virtualization techniques in the form of a digital twin are standardly used for this purpose. The possibility of an initial test of the physical implementation of proposed optimization changes before they are fully implemented into operation is a pragmatic question that still resonates on the production side. Such concerns are justified because the proposed changes in the optimization of production logistics based on simulations from a digital twin tend to be initially costly and affect the existing functional production infrastructure. Therefore, we created a universal CPS based on requirements from our cooperating manufacturing companies. The model fully physically reproduces the real conditions of simulated production and verifies in advance the quality of proposed optimization changes virtually by the digital twin. Optimization costs are also significantly reduced, as it is not necessary to verify the optimization impact directly in production, but only in the physical model. To demonstrate the versatility of deployment, we chose a configuration simulating a robotic assembly workplace and its logistics.	cyber-physical model; digital twin; logistic control algorithms; color sensor; assembly lines; robotic workplace; cyber-physical model;  digital twin;  logistic control algorithms;  color sensor;  assembly lines;  robotic workplace	Vachalek, Jan; Sismisova, Dana; Vasek, Pavol; Fitka, Ivan; Slovak, Juraj; Simovec, Matej	SENSORS	https://doi.org/10.3390/s21051842		2021-12-01 00:00:00	"""@article{WOS:000628561500001,

85	DTCPS	Design and application of digital twin system for the blade-rotor test rig	Digital twin technology is a key technology to realize cyber-physical system. Owing to the problems of low visual monitoring of the blade-rotor test rig and poor equipment monitoring capabilities, this paper proposes a framework based on the digital twin technology. The digital-twin based architecture and major function implementation have been carried out form five dimensions, i.e. Physical layer, Virtual layer, Data layer, Application layer and User layer. Three key technologies utilized to create the system including underlying equipment real-time communication, virtual space building and virtual reality interaction have been demonstrated in this paper. Based on RS-485 and other communication protocols, the data acquisition of the underlying devices have been successfully implemented, and then the real-time data reading has been achieved. Finally, the rationality of the system has been validated by taking the blade-rotor test rig as the application object, which provides a reference for the monitoring and evaluation of equipment involved in manufacturing and experiment.

86	DTCPS	A Novel HDF-Based Data Compression and Integration Approach to Support BIM-GIS Practical Applications	Constructing a fully mapped virtual world is the premise of establishing the digital twin system; thus, the integration of BIM (Building Information Modeling) and GIS (Geographic Information System) constitutes a fundamental part of the mature digital twin. Although quite a few theoretical unified data models of BIM and GIS integration have been presented in precedent research, the practical web-based applications and software support for real-world city information modeling are still difficult to achieve. One of the challenges is storage inefficiency. It thence leads to burdens in exchange and analysis, which hugely impede the realization of virtual-real fusion. To address that issue, in this research, we contribute to exploring an HDF- (Hierarchical Data Format-) based, innovative, and synthesized scheme with three significant technical processes. First, data reorganization trims the original data with efficient redundancy elimination and reordering for IFC-SPF (IFC STEP Physical File) and XML-encoded CityGML (City Geography Markup Language). Next, bidirectional transformation methods for BIM and GIS modeling data, images, and analytical data into HDF are proposed. They retain the entities and relationships in modeling data and can further improve the compactness and accessibility by ultimately 60%-80% which saves 497,612 KB from 565,152 KB in the test of ZhongChun transformation substation. Finally, data aggregation enhances the bond of the integrated model and heterogeneous data resources from the transformed HDF files. The case studies show that the approach proposed in this paper could reach high efficiency for practicability of the BIM + GIS integration model. This light-weight integration method can further improve the front-end service responsiveness in digital twin applications.

First, data reorganization trims the original data with efficient redundancy elimination and reordering for IFC-SPF (IFC STEP Physical File) and XML-encoded CityGML (City Geography Markup Language). Next, bidirectional transformation methods for BIM and GIS modeling data, images, and analytical data into HDF are proposed. They retain the entities and relationships in modeling data and can further improve the compactness and accessibility by ultimately 60\%-80\% which saves 497,612 KB from 565,152 KB in the test of ZhongChun transformation substation. Finally, data aggregation enhances the bond of the integrated model and heterogeneous data resources from the transformed HDF files. The case studies show that the approach proposed in this paper could reach high efficiency for practicability of the BIM + GIS integration model. This light-weight integration method can further improve the front-end service responsiveness in digital twin applications. (c) 2020 Zeyu Pan et al."",

87	DTCPS	Combining simulation and machine learning as digital twin for the manufacturing of overmolded thermoplastic composites	The design and development of composite structures requires precise and robust manufacturing processes. Composite materials such as fiber reinforced thermoplastics (FRTP) provide a good balance between manufacturing time, mechanical performance and weight. In this contribution, we investigate the process combination of thermoforming FRTP sheets (organo sheets) and injection overmolding of short FRTP for automotive structures. The limiting factor in those structures is the bond strength between the organo sheet and the overmolded thermoplastic. Within this process chain, even small deviations of the process settings (e.g., temperature) can lead to significant defects in the structure. A cyber physical production system based framework for a digital twin combining simulation and machine learning is presented. Based on parametric Finite-Element-Method (FEM) studies, training data for machine learning methods are generated and a FEM surrogate is developed. A comparison of different data-driven methods yields information on the estimation accuracy of task-specific data-driven methods. Finally, in accordance with experimental cross tension tests, the investigated FEM surrogate model is able to predict the interface bond strength quality in dependence of the process settings. The visualization into different quality domains qualifies the presented approach as decision support.

89	DTCPS	Concept and Case Study for a Generic Simulation as a Digital Shadow to Be Used for Production Optimisation	Optimising an existing production plant is a challenging task for companies. Necessary physical test runs disturb running production processes. Simulation models are one opportunity to limit these physical test runs. This is particularly important since today's fast and intelligent networking opportunities in production systems are in line with the call of Industry 4.0 for substantial and frequent changes. Creating simulation models for those systems requires high effort and in-depth knowledge of production processes. In the current literature, digital twins promise several advantages for production optimisation and can be used to simulate production systems, which reduce necessary physical test runs and related costs. While most companies are not able to create digital twins yet, companies using enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have the general capability to create digital shadows. This paper presents a concept and a case study for a generic simulation of production systems in AnyLogic (TM) to create digital shadows as the first step towards a full digital twin. The generic simulation visualises production systems automatically and displays key performance indicators (KPIs) for the planned production program, using representational state transfer (REST) interfaces to extract product and production data from an ERP system. The case study has been applied in a learning factory of the University of Applied Life Sciences Emden/Leer. The results prove the presented concept of the generic simulation and show the limits and challenges of working with generic simulation models.	generic simulation; Industry 4.0; digital twin; AnyLogic (TM); digital manufacturing; brownfield; production; generic simulation;  Industry 4.0;  digital twin;  AnyLogic (TM);  digital manufacturing;  brownfield;  production	Kassen, Stefan; Tammen, Holger; Zarte, Maximilian; Pechmann, Agnes	PROCESSES	https://doi.org/10.3390/pr9081362			"""@article{WOS:000689791900001,

90	DTCPS	A Hardware Testbed for Dynamic Data-Driven Aerospace Digital Twins	This paper presents a hardware testbed that furthers the development of a dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS). In particular, the focus of this testbed is on enabling a self-aware unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Self-awareness in this context refers to the ability of the vehicle to collect information about itself and use this information to alter the way it completes missions via on-board dynamic decision-making. Prior work has focused on developing computational methods that enable a digital twin of this vehicle, and demonstration of the resulting self-aware capability via simulation. This work presents a hardware testbed and associated experimental methodology for data collection, analysis, and demonstration of the self-aware UAV concept. The hardware testbed includes custom-built carbon fiber wings, the design of which have been validated via flight test. A sensor suite composed of wireless high frequency dynamic strain sensors has been developed and demonstrated using benchtop experiments. The proposed DDDAS architecture, which includes previously developed computational methods, has the potential to enable two-way coupling between estimation of the UAV structural state and dynamic mission replanning; capability that is critical for realizing the self-aware UAV concept.

91	DTCPS	An Edge Neural Cyber-Physical Production System: Products Monitoring Their Production Recommend Adaptations of Their Schedule	Presented is an edge neural cyber-physical production monitoring system in a German medium-sized enterprise's production process. Each product is equipped with a battery-powered, cost-efficient, not handpicked wireless LAN-microcontroller monitoring its product's production. If a microcontroller observes a significant plan-deviation, it sends a warning message to its product's agent in the planning system recommending an adaptation of the production schedule.The product's monitoring system, its agent in the planning system and its production schedule in combination form the product's digital twin. While the production schedule is passive data, the monitoring system and the agent are active routines. The system is used for retrofitting a production process in order to create transparency of the progress and to implement an adaptive scheduling system immediately reacting to deviations from the planned schedule. It is an implementation of the use case 'Auftragsgesteuerte Produktion' (order-controlled production) of Germany's Plattform Industrie 4.0 [www.plattform-i40.de].Test results prove the system's functionality in the enterprise's process.

92	DTCPS	An approach for adaptive model performance validation within digital twinning	The validation of the operationality of models is considered a crucial step in the model development process. Recent developments in Digital Twinning (DT) enable the online availability of operational data from the physical asset required for operational validation. The benefits of DT in situations where operational validation has formed a basis for model adaptation has also been demonstrated. However, these benefits within DT have not been fully utilized due to the lack of an approach for benchmarking the required quantity, quality and diversity of validation data and performance metrics for online model validation and adaptation. Therefore, there is a need for a framework for benchmarking validation data and metrics requirements during model validation in different domains. An approach for benchmarking the required quantity, quality and variability of validation data and performance metric(s) for online model adaptation within DT is proposed. The approach is focused on addressing the problem of parameter(s) uncertainty of a predictive model within its uncertainty boundary. It involves generating virtual test models, a primary and another reference model for the performance evaluation of one compared to the another with the benchmarked validating data and metrics within DT. This process is repeated until the dataset and/or metric(s) are promising enough to validate primary model against the reference model. The proposed approach is demonstrated using BEASY - a simulator designed to predict protection provided by a cathodic protection system to an asset. In this case, a marine structure is the focus of the study, where the protection potentials to prevent corrosion are predicted over the life of the structure. The algorithm(s) for the approach are provided within a Scientific Software (MATLAB) and integrated to the simulator-based cathodic-protection model.

93	DTCPS	The investigation of dynamic properties of 3D-printed steel parts	Additive technologies are promising for manufacturing parts of metal navigation devices with complex shapes. Finite element analysis is used during the designing of such items. The modeling accuracy is determined by the correctness of the specified physical properties of materials. The properties of materials used in 3D printing significantly differ from the ones used in the traditional manufacturing. Researchers focus on such characteristics as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, hardness and strength. Meanwhile, some applications require dynamic properties. The paper presents the investigation and comparison of damping properties of three steel parts produced by different methods. The first part is manufactured by 3D printing with melting in the transverse direction, and the second part is done by melting in the longitudinal direction, while the third one is traditionally manufactured. The parts are shaft shaped with constant cross-section and have the same geometric dimensions. The TIRA TV 5220 / LS-120 stand is used. A piezoelectric accelerometer is installed at the loose end of the part. The tests are carried out in the frequency range from 15 to 3500 Hz and with an acceleration of 19.6 m/s2 (2 g). The accelerometer output is used to calculate the damping coefficient. The results are verified by comparison with the finite element modeling results. The damping coefficients of transverse and longitudinal 3D-printed parts are 0.022 and 0.006, respectively. The damping coefficient of the traditional manufactured part is 0.023. The difference of 3D-printed parts damping coefficients can be explained by the denser fusion of powder granules when printing one layer than between layers. In this case, a crystal structure with greater rigidity in the printing plane is formed and it limits the dissipation of vibrati on energy due to internal friction. Finite element modeling shows mismatch between the experimental and calculated values of the printed parts natural frequencies. Considering that the values of natural frequencies are largely determined by Young's modulus, a parametric optimization of its value is carried out. It was found that the value of Young's modulus does not correspond to the values determined during tensile tests for similar samples. Thus, 3D-printed parts have different vibration and static stiffness. This is not typical for metals and should be taken into account in simulations. The research results can be used in the simulation model development of steel 3D-printed parts and in the design of digital twins for navigation devices. It allows one to estimate vibration resistance of promising products at the early stages of their design and to optimize the construction minimizing stress.

The damping coefficients of transverse and longitudinal 3D-printed parts are 0.022 and 0.006, respectively. The damping coefficient of the traditional manufactured part is 0.023. The difference of 3D-printed parts damping coefficients can be explained by the denser fusion of powder granules when printing one layer than between layers. In this case, a crystal structure with greater rigidity in the printing plane is formed and it limits the dissipation of vibrati on energy due to internal friction. Finite element modeling shows mismatch between the experimental and calculated values of the printed parts natural frequencies. Considering that the values of natural frequencies are largely determined by Young's modulus, a parametric optimization of its value is carried out. It was found that the value of Young's modulus does not correspond to the values determined during tensile tests for similar samples. Thus, 3D-printed parts have different vibration and static stiffness. This is not typical for metals and should be taken into account in simulations. The research results can be used in the simulation model development of steel 3D-printed parts and in the design of digital twins for navigation devices. It allows one to estimate vibration resistance of promising products at the early stages of their design and to optimize the construction minimizing stress. (c) 2021, ITMO University.

94	DTCPS	Towards Twin-Driven Engineering: Overview of the State-of-The-Art and Research Directions	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex physical systems interacting with a considerable number of distributed computing elements for monitoring, control and management. They are currently becoming larger as Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS), since many industrial companies are transitioning their complex systems of systems to software-intensive solutions in different domains such as production or manufacturing. Following the development and dissemination of DevOps approaches in the Software Engineering world, we propose the Twin-Driven Engineering (TDE) paradigm as a way to upgrade the role of Digital Twins (DT) to become a central point in all the engineering activities on the CPSoS, from design to decommissioning. Since CPSoS can be highly heterogeneous, we rather target the support for producing and maintaining a single integrated virtual representation of the CPSoS (i.e. a System of Twins) on which it is possible to perform global reasoning, analysis and verification. However, such a new paradigm comes with several open research challenges. We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in key areas related to TDE. We identify under-investigated problems in related work and outline corresponding research directions.

95	DTCPS	Towards online adaptation of digital twins	Digital twins have gained a lot of attention in modern day industry, but practical challenges arise from the requirement of continuous and real-time data integration. The actual physical systems are also exposed to disturbances unknown to the real-time simulation. Therefore, adaptation is required to ensure reliable performance and to improve the usability of digital twins in monitoring and diagnostics. This study proposes a general approach to the real-time adaptation of digital twins based on a mechanism guided by evolutionary optimization. The mechanism evaluates the deviation between the measured state of the real system and the estimated state provided by the model under adaptation. The deviation is minimized by adapting the model input based on the differential evolution algorithm. To test the mechanism, the measured data were generated via simulations based on a physical model of the real system. The estimated data were generated by a surrogate model, namely a simplified version of the physical model. A case study is presented where the adaptation mechanism is applied on the digital twin of a marine thruster. Satisfactory accuracy was achieved in the optimization during continuous adaptation. However, further research is required on the algorithms and hardware to reach the real-time computation requirement.	adaptation; differential evolution; digital twin; optimization; surrogate model; adaptation;  differential evolution;  digital twin;  optimization;  surrogate model	Nikula, Riku-Pekka; Paavola, Marko; Ruusunen, Mika; Keski-Rahkonen, Joni	OPEN ENGINEERING	https://doi.org/10.1515/eng-2020-0088		776-783	"""@article{WOS:000563926400001,

97	DTCPS	The Digital Twin as a Common Knowledge Base in DevOps to Support Continuous System Evolution	There is an industry wide push for faster and more feature rich systems, also in the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, the need for applying agile development practices in the model-based design of CPS is becoming more widespread. This is no easy feat, as CPS are inherently complex, and their model-based development is less suited for agile development. Model-based development does suit the concept of digital twin, that is, design models representing a system instance in operation. In this paper we present an approach where the digital twins of system instances serve as a common-knowledge base for the entire agile development cycle of the system when performing system updates. Doing so enables interesting possibilities, such as the identification and detection of system variants, which is beneficial for the verification and validation of the system update. It also brings along challenges, as the executable physics based digital twin is generally computationally expensive. In this paper we introduce this approach by means of a small example of a swiveling pick and place robotic arm. We also elaborate on related work, and open future challenges.

The software includes submodels for determining the main engine parts wear rate and allows to predict engine parts life time, to simulate normal and accelerated engine reliability and durability tests. In the course of the study, the well-known model for determining mechanical frictional losses SLM (Shayler, Leong, Murphy, 2005) was adapted to calculate the relative change in the wear rate of engine parts. Universal equations are obtained to determine the friction forces as applied to rotationally and reciprocally moving engine parts. A method is proposed for calculating the relative change in the wear rate of parts and the time of failure due to wear, taking into account the physical properties (hardness), geometric dimensions and the speed of the relative movement of parts in the conjunction.

100	DTCPS	Mixed-reality automotive testing with sensoris	Highly automated and autonomous vehicles become more and more widespread changing the classical way of testing and validation. Traditionally, the automotive industry has pursued testing rather in real-world or in pure virtual simulation environments. As a new possibility, mixed-reality testing has also appeared enabling an efficient combination of real and simulated elements of testing. Furthermore, vehicles from different OEMs will have a common interface to communicate with a test system. The paper presents a mixed-reality test framework for visualizing perception sensor feeds real-time in the Unity 3D game engine. Thereby, the digital twin of the tested vehicle and its environment are realized in the simulation.

    abstract = ""Highly automated and autonomous vehicles become more and more widespread changing the classical way of testing and validation. Traditionally, the automotive industry has pursued testing rather in real-world or in pure virtual simulation environments. As a new possibility, mixed-reality testing has also appeared enabling an efficient combination of real and simulated elements of testing. Furthermore, vehicles from different OEMs will have a common interface to communicate with a test system. The paper presents a mixed-reality test framework for visualizing perception sensor feeds real-time in the Unity 3D game engine. Thereby, the digital twin of the tested vehicle and its environment are realized in the simulation. The communication between the sensors of the tested vehicle and the central computer running the test is realized via the standard SENSORIS interface. The paper outlines the hardware and software requirements towards such a system in detail. To show the viability of the system a vehicle in the loop test has been carried out.

101	DTCPS	Model improvement with experimental design for identifying error sources in a computational model	Optimization-based model improvement has been introduced as a strategy to enhance the prediction ability of a computational model. It involves model calibration, model validation, and model refinement. Model calibration estimates the optimal value of unknown parameters. Model validation determines the validity of a computational model, and model refinement enhances a model to improve its accuracy. In model improvement, a variety of sources of errors in the observation and prediction can interrupt the model improvement process. The error sources degrade the parameter estimation accuracy in model calibration. When a computational model turns out to be invalid because of these error sources, model refinement is required. However, since model validation cannot distinguish between parameter estimation errors and modeling errors, the existing method is difficult to refine the computational model efficiently. Thus, this study aims to develop a model improvement process that identifies the leading cause of invalidity of a prediction. In this work, an experimental design method is integrated with optimization-based model improvement to minimize the effect of estimation errors in model calibration. Through use of the proposed method, after calibration, the computational model mainly includes the effect of unrecognized modeling errors. Two case studies are provided to confirm the efficacy of the proposed method: an analytical beam study and automotive wheel rim analysis.

102	DTCPS	Interacting with Intelligent Digital Twins	This paper details the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) components of an Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) system for a semiconductor manufacturing company using gamming visual effects, 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) and sound effects. The designed digital twin (DT) system will allow users to detect any irregularities (such as equipment failures and defects) in the manufacturing processes, in a timely manner and test some changes without an actual touching of the physical components. The project aims to design an IDT system that enhances the user's interaction by visualizing big data in such a way which can be easily understood and processed. Thus, allowing the user to intervene and control the entire production processes from the virtual console. The designed IDT system will enhance the UX of the system through the use of new interaction methodologies. The user will have full control of the data flow which is flowing from a data lake through for example, a gazing, a gesturing and a voice recognition interface which will provide contextual information based upon the user's viewpoint. The current phase of the project investigates the use of Cave VR technology to improve the immersion and the interaction between the user and the virtual system. We seek to develop a virtual environment that makes the users feel they are naturally interacting in a visually-immersed environment irrespective of where they are located. By enhancing the interaction of the user with these new technologies, we will provide a better UX that would create an efficient system which reduces the overall costs of managing the plant and concretely realize the aspirations of Industry 4.0.

103	DTCPS	Method for the generation of stochastic wind fields fitted to measurement data in real-time	The excitation of the wind turbine by the wind represents one of the main sources of excitation for the components of the wind turbine. The resulting structural loads can be measured relatively easily. The measurement of wind excitation, however, is much more complex. Even with the latest measuring equipment, such as LiDAR, the spatially and temporally high-resolution wind measurement required for the validation of the load measurement in the time domain can only be realized with a disproportionately high financial outlay and is thus unsuitable for large-scale application in the field. The method presented here shall be able to generate a realistic spatial wind excitation by means of the measured wind information present at each wind turbine, thus enabling model and load validation in the time domain. Furthermore, the method is fast enough to calculate the wind excitation in real time, allowing for application in Hardware-in-Loop or as part of a digital twin of the wind turbine.	wind generation; load validation; real-time simulation; stochastic process; CTRW; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; wind generation;  load validation;  real-time simulation;  stochastic process;  CTRW;  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process	Thomas, Philipp; Szyslo, Tom	SCIENCE OF MAKING TORQUE FROM WIND (TORQUE 2020), PTS 1-5	https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1618/6/062043			"""@inproceedings{WOS:000686550403033,

104	DTCPS	Industry 4.0 Visual Tools for Digital Twin System Design	This work analyses methods of digital model development and uses electronics production as an example. It focuses on the analysis of the visual tools of a digital manufacturing system design. The digital model development process is divided into a sequence of tasks, to solve which a number of models, methods and tools is proposed. These procedures can be used to perform simulation modelling, performance prediction, promising option selection, parameters optimisation of both the device itself and its manufacturing mechanisms along with other lifecycle components, without the expensive sample tests, field tests or introduction of any changes to the already established manufacturing, selling, service and other infrastructures. Digitalisation aspects are covered by creating interrelated digital models of the device and the digital manufacturing process model that take all the technical and economic aspects into account. This approach, called Digital Twin (of the actual production), underlies the modern Industry 4.0 concept that suggests the introduction of different cyber-physical systems in the manufacturing systems. The proposed method of the visual system design uses a complex of software tools to produce digital system models of an electronics manufacturing system.

106	DTCPS	Enterprise Service Remote Assistance Guidance System Based on Digital Twin Drive	In the fourth industrial revolution to develop new products and processes, the digital twin, virtual copies of the system that can interact with the physical counterparts in a bidirectional way, seem to be promising enablers to replicate production systems in real time and analyze them. They aim to solve insufficient guidance methods in the existing enterprise service remote assistance guidance system. In this paper, a digital twin-driven enterprise service remote assistance guidance system is proposed. The digital twin system is designed to carry out different all-around analyses of the remote internal system. The digital and physical spaces of the enterprise service system are reset according to the data query results. The proposed model achieves the internal data mapping effect of the enterprise service and analyzes the internal data of the system. Based on the realization of real-time mapping and a large amount of twin data generated by virtual and real interaction, the data are visualized and stored in a database for the upper layers. The proposed model has been simulated, and the test results show its potential benefits for enterprise control, optimization, and forecasting and can provide essential support for realizing the twin's optimized control of entities.

108	DTCPS	Digital twin reference model development to prevent operators' risk in process plants	In the literature, many applications of Digital Twin methodologies in the manufacturing, construction and oil and gas sectors have been proposed, but there is still no reference model specifically developed for risk control and prevention. In this context, this work develops a Digital Twin reference model in order to define conceptual guidelines to support the implementation of Digital Twin for risk prediction and prevention. The reference model proposed in this paper is made up of four main layers (Process industry physical space, Communication system, Digital Twin and User space), while the implementation steps of the reference model have been divided into five phases (Development of the risk assessment plan, Development of the communication and control system, Development of Digital Twin tools, Tools integration in a Digital Twin perspective and models and Platform validation). During the design and implementation phases of a Digital Twin, different criticalities must be taken into consideration concerning the need for deterministic transactions, a large number of pervasive devices, and standardization issues. Practical implications of the proposed reference model regard the possibility to detect, identify and develop corrective actions that can affect the safety of operators, the reduction of maintenance and operating costs, and more general improvements of the company business by intervening both in strictly technological and organizational terms.	business; communication; conceptual framework; construction; design; guideline; maintenance; manufacturing; risk assessment; safety; standardization; business;  communication;  conceptual framework;  construction;  design;  guideline;  maintenance;  manufacturing;  risk assessment;  safety;  standardization	Bevilacqua, Maurizio; Bottani, Eleonora; Ciarapica, Filippo Emanuele; Costantino, Francesco; Donato, Luciano Di; Ferraro, Alessandra; Mazzuto, Giovanni; Monteriu, Andrea; Nardini, Giorgia; Ortenzi, Marco; Paroncini, Massimo; Pirozzi, Marco; Prist, Mario; Quatrini, Elena; Tronci, Massimo; Vignali, Giuseppe	Sustainability (Switzerland)	https://doi.org/10.3390/su12031088			"""@ARTICLE{Bevilacqua2020,

109	DTCPS	Digital Twin--The Simulation Aspect	The vision of theDigital Twinitself refers to a comprehensive physical and functional description of a component, product or system, which includes more or less all information which could be useful in all--the current and subsequent--lifecycle phases. In this chapter we focus on the simulation aspects of theDigital Twin. Today, modelling and simulation is a standard process in system development, e.g. to support design tasks or to validate system properties. During operation and for service first simulation-based solutions are realized for optimized operations and failure prediction. In this sense, simulation merges the physical and virtual world in all life cycle phases. Current practice already enables the users (designer, SW/HW developers, test engineers, operators, maintenance personnel, etc) to master the complexity of mechatronic systems.

110	DTCPS	Digital Twin of Beam Pumping Unit Control and Analysis	The software model of beam pumping unit was built through the physical simulation pumping unit lifting system in the Internet of Things laboratory, and the lifting model was updated after mutual verification to form the digital twin system of oil and gas production lifting. Based on the digital twin of beam pumping unit and the real-time data of oil and gas production, the whole process of oil and gas lifting process production is formed, and a flexible closed-loop control method based on the digital twin is obtained. The method is based on the detailed and in-depth analysis of the whole movement, which selecting the load as the monitoring physical quantity, and improving the system efficiency. The method is to change the maximum and minimum load, reduce the input power and improve the system efficiency under the condition of maintaining a certain output. By comparing and analyzing the indicator diagram of oil well production before and after the flexible control, the flexible control method based on digital twin reduces the loss of mechanical operation and saves the consumption of electric energy, so that the efficiency of the pumping unit's lifting system reaches the maximum. At the same time, the control and analysis method based on digital twinning is a self-diagnosis, adjustment and control method of intelligent ecology, which is the inevitable trend of the development of intelligent oilfield.

    abstract = ""The software model of beam pumping unit was built through the physical simulation pumping unit lifting system in the Internet of Things laboratory, and the lifting model was updated after mutual verification to form the digital twin system of oil and gas production lifting. Based on the digital twin of beam pumping unit and the real-time data of oil and gas production, the whole process of oil and gas lifting process production is formed, and a flexible closed-loop control method based on the digital twin is obtained. The method is based on the detailed and in-depth analysis of the whole movement, which selecting the load as the monitoring physical quantity, and improving the system efficiency. The method is to change the maximum and minimum load, reduce the input power and improve the system efficiency under the condition of maintaining a certain output. By comparing and analyzing the indicator diagram of oil well production before and after the flexible control, the flexible control method based on digital twin reduces the loss of mechanical operation and saves the consumption of electric energy, so that the efficiency of the pumping unit's lifting system reaches the maximum. At the same time, the control and analysis method based on digital twinning is a self-diagnosis, adjustment and control method of intelligent ecology, which is the inevitable trend of the development of intelligent oilfield.

With its unique properties of immersive visual display and transparent screen, we designed and implemented a rich set of novel interaction techniques like immersive presentation, role-play, and lecturing behind the scene that are potentially valuable for lecturing in class. We conducted a controlled experimental study to compare a HoloBoard class with a normal class through measuring students' learning outcomes and three dimensions of engagement (i.e., behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement). We used pre-/post- knowledge tests and multimodal learning analytics to measure students' learning outcomes and learning experiences. Results indicated that the lecture-based class utilizing HoloBoard lead to slightly better learning outcomes and a significantly higher level of student engagement.

112	DTCPS	Designing a Multi-Agent Occupant Simulation System to Support Facility Planning and Analysis for COVID-19	The COVID-19 pandemic changed our lives, forcing us to reconsider our built environment, architectural designs, and even behaviours. Multiple stakeholders, including designers, building facility managers, and policy makers, are making decisions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and make our environment safer; however, systems to effectively and interactively evaluate virus transmission in physical spaces are lacking. To help fill this gap, we propose OccSim, a system that automatically generates occupancy behaviours in a 3D model of a building and helps users analyze the potential effect of virus transmission from a large-scale and longitudinal perspective. Our participatory evaluation with four groups of stakeholders revealed that OccSim could enhance their decision making processes by identifying specific risks of virus transmission in advance, and illuminating how each risk relates to complex human-building interactions.

114	DTCPS	Digital Twin: Mitigating Unpredictable, Undesirable Emergent Behavior in Complex Systems	"Systems do not simply pop into existence. They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to ""normal accidents."" We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin."

115	DTCPS	Digital Twin Application for the Temperature and Steam Flow Monitoring of a Food Pasteurization Pilot Plant	In this paper, the development of a Digital Twin of a beverages pasteurization system for temperature monitoring, using NI Lab-VIEW control system toolkit, is described. A cyber-physical production system, composed of a real-time simulation tool and a controller, has been set up and tested on a pilot plant set up in a university laboratory. The paper shows how the software platform, together with the hardware, has been implemented in a traditional system, not (yet) ready for Industry 4.0 technologies, and therefore underlines the main issues occurred during its development. The Digital Twin includes a CompactRIO controller and a set of probes, connected with the controller. The aim of the Digital Twin is to monitor the machine status, with a particular attention to the temperature reached by the service water and the required steam flow. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this system, a set of experimental tests has also been carried out.

116	DTCPS	Digital twin approach for intelligent operation planning and health management of mechanical systems	The digital twin paradigm aims to fuse information obtained from sensor data, physics models, and operational data for a mechanical component in use to make well-informed decisions regarding health management and operations of the component. In this work, we discuss a methodology for digital-twin-based operation planning in mechanical systems to enable: a) cost-effective maintenance scheduling, and b) resilient operations of the system. As properties of mechanical systems, as well as their operational parameters, loads and environment are stochastic in nature, our methodology includes probabilistic damage diagnosis, probabilistic damage prognosis, and system optimization under uncertainty. As an illustrative example, we consider the problem of fatigue crack growth in a metal component. We discuss a probabilistic, ultrasonic-guided-wave-based crack diagnosis framework that can handle both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in the diagnosis process. We build a high-fidelity, finite element model to simulate the piezoelectric effect and ultrasonic guided wave propagation. We use test data obtained by conducting diagnostic experiments on the physical twin to calibrate the error in the diagnosis model. We perform Bayesian diagnosis of crack growth using the corrected diagnosis model, considering data corrupted by measurement noise, and fuse the information from multiple sensors. We build a finite-element-based high-fidelity model for crack growth under uniaxial cyclic loading, and calibrate a phenomenological (low-fidelity) fatigue crack growth model using the high-fidelity model output as well as data from fatigue loading experiments performed on the physical twin. We use the resulting multi-fidelity model in a probabilistic crack growth prognosis framework; thus achieving both accuracy and computational efficiency. Lastly, we utilize the damage diagnosis framework along with the damage prognosis model to optimize system operations under diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty. We perform simulation experiments that show how the digital twin of the component of interest can be used for intelligent health management and operation planning for mechanical systems.

117	DTCPS	Digital tests of the robotic chassis' cyber-physical system for agricultural unmanned vehicle	The report explored the problem of digital testing of a robotic agricultural vehicle. The approach to representing the robotic chassis as a cyber-physical system is to build a complex of digital models of units and built-in measuring tools for monitoring physical processes. Based on a model-oriented approach, a digital twin of a robotic chassis for diagnostics and forecasting was built. Information from the vehicle's on-board measurement system is used to continuously correct model parameters. Models of a car driver, chassis, individual units, and subsystems have been developed. A car model with fifteen degrees of freedom is described. The simulation results for various scenarios of the movement of a robotic vehicle are presented. The simulation results were used in the design of the KAMAZ unmanned vehicle for agricultural purposes.

The approach to representing the robotic chassis as a cyber-physical system is to build a complex of digital models of units and built-in measuring tools for monitoring physical processes. Based on a model-oriented approach, a digital twin of a robotic chassis for diagnostics and forecasting was built. Information from the vehicle's on-board measurement system is used to continuously correct model parameters. Models of a car driver, chassis, individual units, and subsystems have been developed. A car model with fifteen degrees of freedom is described. The simulation results for various scenarios of the movement of a robotic vehicle are presented. The simulation results were used in the design of the KAMAZ unmanned vehicle for agricultural purposes. (c) Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."",

119	DTCPS	Digital and Physical Testbed for Production Logistics Operations	Digitalisation and automation of existing processes are key factors for competitive industry, but still logistics operations are often dominated by manual work. A shift towards higher degree of automation within existing infrastructure is often challenged by high cost and complex processes, thus a return-on-investment is hardly achievable within decent time. The experience has shown that it is hard to assess all restrictions and interactions between new and old components before any new equipment or infrastructure is implemented and put into operation. This paper presents and discusses if the usage of digital twins representing and simulating a physical part can support the related assessing and decision-making processes. In this context, this paper presents a production logistics test-bed includes physical devices, an IoT-infrastructure and simulation software for innovation as well as operational management purposes.

120	DTCPS	Development of Digital Twin for Load Center on the Example of Distribution Network of an Urban District	The paper proposes a concept of building a digital twin based on the reinforcement learning method. This concept allows implementing an accurate digital model of an electrical network with bidirectional automatic data exchange, used for modeling, optimization, and control. The core of such a model is an agent (potential digital twin). The agent, while constantly interacting with a physical object (electrical grid), searches for an optimal strategy for active network management, which involves short-term strategies capable of controlling the power supplied by generators and/or consumed by the load to avoid overload or voltage problems. Such an agent can verify its training with the initial default policy, which can be considered as a teacher's advice. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on a test 77-node scheme and a real 17-node network diagram of the Akademgorodok microdistrict (Irkutsk) according to the data from smart electricity meters.

122	DTCPS	Dealing with Uncertainty in Software Architecture on the Internet-of-Things with Digital Twins	When architecting Software-intensive Systems-of-Systems (SoS) on the Internet-of-Things (IoT), architects face two sorts of uncertainties. First, they have only limited knowledge about the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed. Second, the constituent systems which will compose the SoS might not be known a priori (at design-time) or their availability (at run-time) is affected by dynamic factors, due to the openness of the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to deal with uncertainty in the design of an SoS architecture on the IoT. To tackle this challenging issue, this paper addresses the notion of uncertainty due to partial information in SoS and proposes an enhanced SoS Architecture Description language (SosADL) for expressing SoS architectures on the IoT under uncertainty. The core SosADL is extended with concurrent constraints and the concept of digital twins coupling the physical and virtual worlds. This novel approach is supported by an integrated toolset, the SosADL Studio. Validation results demonstrate its effectiveness in an SoS architecture for platooning of self-driving vehicles.

123	DTCPS	Computer Vision with Cognitive Learning to Improve the Decision-Making During the Sales Process in Physical Stores	In a world where the information is obtained faster than ever seem, new methods to process that high volume of data are being developed frequently. This is more notorious in a virtual ambient where the data is generated in a manner that is faster and easier to analyze than in the real world. This is very evident in the retail field, where virtual stores have easy access to all the advertisement a user visited and simple to obtain user profile, on the other hand physical stores are limited to basically create a register in a database when there is a purchase. In an attempt to improve the retailers experience from physical stores to manage their business this document has the objective to develop a computational tool that will analyze the people flux going in the establishment, trying to inform the retailer the amount of people and their gender to help the sales process in physical stores. To this end, computational vision methods and algorithms were raised, which after selection, theoretical conception and tool's implementation it was tested with benchmarks to operate locally and in real time by accessing the cameras installed strategically in a real scenario. Two scenarios were tested: static ambient light and dynamic light. Two tests were conducted: YOLOv2 against background subtraction-based counter; gender classification using full body features. Even though the results were not as positive as needed for commercial use, the tool demonstrated potential and space for improvements.

124	DTCPS	Creating the foundation for digital twins in the manufacturing industry: an integrated installed base management system	Services play an important role in the manufacturing industry. A shift in emphasis from selling physical products to offering product-service systems is perceived. Detailed knowledge of machines, components and subcomponents in whole plants must be provided. Installed base management contributes to this and enables services in manufacturing to maintain high machine availability and reduce downtimes. Installed base management assists in data structuring and management. By combining installed base data with sensor data, a digital twin of the installed base results. Following the action design research approach, an integrated installed base management system for manufacturing is presented and implemented in practice. An engineering and manufacturing company is involved in the research process and ensures practical relevance. Requirements are not only deduced from the literature but also identified in focus group discussions. A detailed test run with real data is performed for evaluation purpose using a demonstration machine. To enable a generalization, design principles for the development and implementation of such an integrated installed base management system are created.

126	DTCPS	Capabilities of the regional cabin demonstrator as digital twin for a future test mock-up	Digital twins are essential for Industry 4.0 and the digitalization of research, development and manufacturing. By now, the models contain more and more information and are already often highly complex systems. However, an important step is to keep the model as simple as possible in order to reduce computing resources and the associated simulation time. The Indoor Environment Simulation Suite (IESS) is a tool to generate a zonal model from a CAD geometry. It is designed to simulate the transient indoor climate in a short time, while still considering all important physical processes (heat conduction, radiation, convection). After the zonal model has been generated, the user can parameterize it specifically to the application and couple it with other models when needed. Here, a new approach is to integrate a thermo-physiological model of the human body in order to make statements about the human perception of thermal comfort. This is of particular interest in early development phases in order to assess air conditioning strategies as well as structural or technical adaptions due to thermal bridges or other influences on the cabin climate. In this paper a concept will be presented where the zonal model is coupled with the thermo-physiological model to investigate selected case studies on how thermal comfort in a regional aircraft can be assessed and considered in early design phases. The cabin model is based on a new type of regional aircraft for which a mock-up is currently being built in order to perform subject test at the Fraunhofer Institute in Holzkirchen. The thermal model can thus make statements in advance about how test scenarios should be carried out in order to gain the greatest possible benefit from the subject study tests, where the number of different tests is limited.

127	DTCPS	Application of a Simulation-Based Digital Twin for Predicting Distributed Manufacturing Control System Performance	During the last years, several research activities and studies have presented the possibility to perform manufacturing control using distributed approaches. Although these new approaches aim to deliver more flexibility and adaptability to the shop floor, they are not being readily adopted and utilised by the manufacturers. One of the main challenges is the unpredictability of the proposed solutions and the uncertainty associated with these approaches. Hence, the proposed research aims to explore the utilisation of Digital Twins (DTs) to predict and understand the execution of these systems in runtime. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is leading to the emergence of new concepts amongst which DT stand out. Given their early stage, however, the already existing implementations are far from standardised, meaning that each practical case has to be analysed on its own and solutions are often created from scratch. Taking the aforementioned into account, the authors suggest an architecture that enables the integration between a previously designed and developed agent-based distributed control system and its DT, whose implementation is also provided in detail.

    Abstract = ""During the last years, several research activities and studies have presented the possibility to perform manufacturing control using distributed approaches. Although these new approaches aim to deliver more flexibility and adaptability to the shop floor, they are not being readily adopted and utilised by the manufacturers. One of the main challenges is the unpredictability of the proposed solutions and the uncertainty associated with these approaches. Hence, the proposed research aims to explore the utilisation of Digital Twins (DTs) to predict and understand the execution of these systems in runtime. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is leading to the emergence of new concepts amongst which DT stand out. Given their early stage, however, the already existing implementations are far from standardised, meaning that each practical case has to be analysed on its own and solutions are often created from scratch. Taking the aforementioned into account, the authors suggest an architecture that enables the integration between a previously designed and developed agent-based distributed control system and its DT, whose implementation is also provided in detail. Furthermore, the digital model's calibration is described jointly with the careful validation process carried out. Thanks to the latter, several conclusions and guidelines for future implementations were possible to derive as well."",

128	DTCPS	ASAMS: An Adaptive Sequential Sampling and Automatic Model Selection for Artificial Intelligence Surrogate Modeling	Surrogate Modeling (SM) is often used to reduce the computational burden of time-consuming system simulations. However, continuous advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the spread of embedded sensors have led to the creation of Digital Twins (DT), Design Mining (DM), and Soft Sensors (SS). These methodologies represent a new challenge for the generation of surrogate models since they require the implementation of elaborated artificial intelligence algorithms and minimize the number of physical experiments measured. To reduce the assessment of a physical system, several existing adaptive sequential sampling methodologies have been developed; however, they are limited in most part to the Kriging models and Kriging-model-based Monte Carlo Simulation. In this paper, we integrate a distinct adaptive sampling methodology to an automated machine learning methodology (AutoML) to help in the process of model selection while minimizing the system evaluation and maximizing the system performance for surrogate models based on artificial intelligence algorithms. In each iteration, this framework uses a grid search algorithm to determine the best candidate models and perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to calculate the performance of each sampled point. A Voronoi diagram is applied to partition the sampling region into some local cells, and the Voronoi vertexes are considered as new candidate points. The performance of the sample points is used to estimate the accuracy of the model for a set of candidate points to select those that will improve more the model's accuracy. Then, the number of candidate models is reduced. Finally, the performance of the framework is tested using two examples to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.	surrogate model; adaptive sequential sampling; machine learning; surrogate model;  adaptive sequential sampling;  machine learning	Duchanoy, Carlos A.; Calvo, Hiram; Moreno-Armendariz, Marco A.

129	DTCPS	Enterprise Feature Ontology for Feature-based Product Line Engineering and Operations	Feature trees have been the standard data structure for representing product diversity in feature-based systems and software product line engineering (PLE). For basic product lines of modest size or complexity, one or several modular feature trees can be sufficient for managing the and resolving the variation present across the engineering assets in the systems engineering 'V' --- from requirements, to design, through implementation, verification, validation, documentation, and more --- in the software, mechanical, and electrical disciplines. However, enterprises seeking to adopt PLE at all levels of their organization, including areas such as product marketing, portfolio planning, manufacturing, supply chain, product sales, product service and maintenance, Internet-of-Things, resource planning, and much more are finding that thousands of nonengineering users need different views and interaction scenarios with a feature diversity representation. This paper describes a feature ontology (a specification of the meaning of terms in the feature modeling realm) that is suitable for managing the feature-based product line engineering and operations in the largest and most complex product line organizations. This ontology is based on layers of abstraction that each incrementally constrain the complexity and combinatorics and targets specific roles in the organization for greater degrees of efficiency, precision, and automation across an entire business enterprise.	variation points;  software product lines;  product portfolio;  product configurator;  feature-based product line engineering;  feature profiles;  feature modeling;  enterprise feature ontology;  bill-of-features;  Product line engineering;  PLE factory; variation points, software product lines, product portfolio, product configurator, feature-based product line engineering, feature profiles, feature modeling, enterprise feature ontology, bill-of-features, Product line engineering, PLE factory	Krueger, Charles; Clements, Paul	SPLC '17: Proceedings of the 21st International Systems and Software Product Line Conference - Volume A	https://doi.org/10.1145/3106195.3106218		227-236	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3106195.3106218,

132	DTCPS	Mixed Reality Environment for Complex Scenario Testing	Driver assistance systems are currently evaluated using standardized test procedures as defined, for example, by Euro NCAP, but which only represent a narrow, idealized spectrum of real-life situations. Test conditions hardly take into account the variability that occur in everyday traffic - adverse weather conditions such as fog, rain, snow or darkness are typically not considered, nor are the resulting changes in, e.g., the behavior of pedestrians. In an emergency braking situation, the behavior of the VRU can also be directly affected by the interaction with the vehicle. For example, a pedestrian might be alarmed by an approaching car. This could elicit a very different response in the human that cannot be simulated in the dummy motion as defined in the standard test procedure. In order to create a more versatile and interactive simulation and test environment, we have developed the Mixed Reality Test Environment MiRE. The goal of Mixed Reality Test Environment MiRE is to enable testing of a broader range of scenarios, including interaction between VRUs and vehicles. During the demo, we will demonstrate MiRE live to interested visitors and show its full potential for future driving safety tests.

134	DTCPS	Fused Twins: A Cognitive Approach to Augmented Reality Media Architecture	Recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR), the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and Digital Twins transform the types, rates, and volume of information generated in buildings as well as the mediums through which they can be perceived by users. These advances push the standard approach of media architecture to embed screens in the built environment to its limits because screens lack the immersive capacity that newer media afford. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AR approach to media architecture that uses a Digital Twin as a platform for structuring and accessing data from various sources, including IoT and simulations. Our technical contribution to media architecture is threefold. First, we extend the possibilities of media architecture beyond embedded screens to three dimensions by presenting a Digital Twin using AR with a head-mounted display. This approach results in a shared and consistent augmented experience across large architectural spaces. Second, we use the Digital Twin to integrate and visualize real physical sensor information. Third, we make artificial occupancy simulations accessible to everyday users by presenting them within their natural context in the Digital Twin. Observing the Digital Twin in situ of the Physical Twin also has applications beyond media architecture. Fusing the two twins using AR can reduce the cognitive load of users from consuming big and complex information sources and enhance their experience. We present two use cases of the proposed Fused Twins in a university building at ETH Zurich. In the first use case, we visualize a dense indoor sensor network (DISN) with 390 IoT sensors that collected data from March 2020 to May 2021. In the second use case, we immerse visitors in agent-based simulations to enable insights into the real and projected uses of space. This work brings forward an ambitious vision for media architecture beyond traditional flat screens, and showcases its potential through fusing state of the art simulations, sensor data integration and augmented reality, finally making the jump from fiction to reality.

135	DTCPS	The virtual twin: controlling smart factories using a spatially-correct augmented reality representation	With the advent of digitalization in industrial settings, referred to as Industry 4.0, more and more machine data is being collected and analyzed during a machine's life cycle. The availability to leverage machine data allows the concept of the Digital Twin. The more data that is collected the more statistically relevant and reliable the digital representation. This data within the Digital Twin is usually hard to access and to consume by humans. Typically, there is just a web-based user interface or basic queries available to mine the data. Therefore, we propose the concept of a Virtual Twin, which is an interactive virtual representation (virtual 3D model) of a physical object. The benefit of a Virtual Twin is that machines and equipment are arranged in the same way and at the same position in relation to each other as their real-world counterparts. The virtual 3D representation functions as an intuitive gateway to the corresponding Digital Twin. In this paper, we present the concept and implementation of the Virtual Twin and discuss potential use cases as well as areas of application.	virtual twin;  hololens;  digital twin;  augmented reality; virtual twin, hololens, digital twin, augmented reality	Kritzler, Mareike; Funk, Markus; Michahelles, Florian; Rohde, Wolfgang	IoT '17: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on the Internet of Things	https://doi.org/10.1145/3131542.3140274		1-2	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3131542.3140274,

136	DTCPS	A visual programming approach based on domain ontologies for configuring industrial IoT installations	Industrial products tend to be customized by third-parties for different use cases. This is currently supported by adding external Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) to installations. As IoT software ecosystems become wide-spread, the need for such hardware will decrease. However, removing the controllers opens the challenge of configuring distributed industrial installations. This paper argues for modeling application requirements on industrial installations so that they can be evaluated automatically based on information about targeted installations. GIMLE, a visual language for modeling application requirements using expressive domain knowledge, is proposed. GIMLE enables modeling requirements on physical features of installations, which hasn't received significant attention in the related work. A study with domain experts is used to reflect on the proposed process. The scalability of the visual language is evaluated using a model for a real-world application. The support for reuse of requirements enabled us to build models that can add support for new installations without significant changes and with a slower increase in size the more components can be reused.	visual programming;  modeling;  end-user programming; visual programming, modeling, end-user programming	Tomlein, Mat\'{u}\v{s}; Gr\o{}nb\ae{}k, Kaj	IoT '17: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on the Internet of Things	https://doi.org/10.1145/3131542.3131552		1-9	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3131542.3131552,

Using transfer learning with a pre-trained Faster R-CNN network, we are able to train a parkour training spot detector with only a few thousand street level photographs. We utilize a simple and efficient annotation scheme that only required a few days of annotation work by parkour hobbyists, and should be easily applicable in other contexts, e.g. skateboarding. The technology is tested through parkour spot exploration and visualization experiments. To inform and motivate the technology development, we also conducted an interview study about what makes an interesting parkour spot and how parkour hobbyists find spots.

This survey discusses 260 articles (68.8\% of articles published between 2015-2019) to review the field of human interaction in connected cities with emphasis on augmented reality-driven interaction. We provide an overview of Human-City Interaction and related technological approaches, followed by reviewing the latest trends of information visualization, constrained interfaces, and embodied interaction for AR headsets. We highlight under-explored issues in interface design and input techniques that warrant further research and conjecture that AR with complementary Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) is a crucial enabler for ubiquitous interaction with immersive systems in smart cities. Our work helps researchers understand the current potential and future needs of AR in Human-City Interaction.

We provide an overview of Human-City Interaction and related technological approaches, followed by reviewing the latest trends of information visualization, constrained interfaces, and embodied interaction for AR headsets. We highlight under-explored issues in interface design and input techniques that warrant further research and conjecture that AR with complementary Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) is a crucial enabler for ubiquitous interaction with immersive systems in smart cities.

142	DTCPS	Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors as Physical Unclonable Identifiers in Anti-counterfeiting	Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors (CSRs) are made of droplets of cholesteric liquid crystals (the same material under the screen of our mobile phones) but molded in a spherical shape and hardened into a solid. CSRs have a peculiar behavior when illuminated: they reflect light and produce unique optical patterns whose full display is hardly predictable. They have been argued to behave like an optical Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), therefore finding application in anti-counterfeiting, in particular for object authentication. However, a fundamental challenge remains open: to understand what makes each optical response unique and how to extract this identifying information reliably and repeatedly. We study the problem, and we design and discuss two pivotal procedures to build authentication protocols for objects coated with CSRs. We test the quality of our procedures against large data sets of pattern images: images from CSRs are used to calculate inter- and intra-distance; simulated patterns created artificially are used to measure security in terms of false positive ratio. Our procedures successfully cluster images coming from the same CSR, distinguishing them from images of different CSRs and decoys. Our work is one of the few that has studied procedures of information extraction for materials derived from CSRs. It advances the state of the art in this area, closing the gap between the research on optical PUFs and practical applications.

146	DTCPS	Reference Framework for Digital Twins within Cyber-Physical Systems	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) represent systems which integrate physical units and processes with computational entities over Internet and allow ubiquitous access of information and services. Although the application of CPSs promise to positively transform many application fields, there are still many open questions and challenges on how to design and realize a CPS. As indicated in the third level of the 5-level CPS architecture, the so-called cyber level, one of the challenges addresses the need for digital twins as high-fidelity mirroring images of CPSs entities. This is a prerequisite to realize the upper levels of the 5-level CPS architecture - the cognition and configuration level. In the scientific literature, the concept of a Digital Twin is introduced as a concrete realization for mirroring physical entities in the virtual world. However, a reference framework for the main building blocks of a Digital Twin framework is missing. This hinders a reuse of best practices and proven solutions for concrete realizations of a Digital Twin. In order to tackle this problem, we have established a reference framework for Digital Twins within a CPS. Our framework specifies the main building blocks of a Digital Twin in terms of structure and interrelations. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic literature review, where we evaluated existing Digital Twin realizations used in different application domains of CPSs and we applied Grounded Theory and Framework Analysis as underlying methodologies. This reference framework serves a blueprint for developing Digital Twins of physical entities which are part of a CPS.

147	DTCPS	Model-Driven Systems Engineering for Virtual Product Design	Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) aims to provide a systems engineering methodology that leverages modeling methods to support design, analysis, verification, and validation of systems. As such, methodologies for MBSE have to be able to integrate heterogeneous engineering models from a variety of domains, including mechanical engineering, product design, legislation, and many more. Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations. We present a method to integrate abstract system descriptions in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, which are not only the primary model for geometrical hardware descriptions but also the starting point of most process chains in the context of virtual product development. The transformations of our method are realized in a plug-in for the MagicDraw modeling environment and support to generate parameters of a parameter and constraint CAD modeling approach from a SysML model. This automates the integration of abstract system descriptions with design models to foster a coherent virtual product development.

149	DTCPS	Equilibrium Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Ride-hailing Vehicle Network	Ubiquitous mobile computing have enabled ride-hailing services to collect vast amounts of behavioral data of riders and drivers and optimize supply and demand matching in real time. While these mobility service providers have some degree of control over the market by assigning vehicles to requests, they need to deal with the uncertainty arising from self-interested driver behavior since workers are usually free to drive when they are not assigned tasks. If a driver's behavior can be accurately replicated on the digital twin, more detailed and realistic counterfactual simulations will enable decision making to improve mobility services as well as to validate urban planning. In this work, we formulate the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and proposed an algorithm to derive an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework combines value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy given expected state visitation and policy propagation to compute multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Furthermore, we developed a method to learn the driver's reward function transferable to an environment with significantly different dynamics from training data. We evaluated the robustness to changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and deterioration in data quality using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset; our approach significantly outperforms several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy. The computational time required to obtain an equilibrium policy shared by all vehicles does not depend on the number of agents, and even on the scale of real-world services, it takes only a few seconds on a single CPU.	inverse reinforcement learning;  equilibrium;  Markov games;  Counterfactual simulation; inverse reinforcement learning, equilibrium, Markov games, Counterfactual simulation	Oda, Takuma	WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021	https://doi.org/10.1145/3442381.3449935		2281-2290	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3442381.3449935,

150	DTCPS	3D Hand Pose Estimation on Conventional Capacitive Touchscreens	Contemporary mobile devices with touchscreens capture the X/Y position of finger tips on the screen and pass these coordinates to applications as though the input were points in space. Of course, human hands are much more sophisticated, able to form rich 3D poses capable of far more complex interactions than poking at a screen. In this paper, we describe how conventional capacitive touchscreens can be used to estimate 3D hand pose, enabling richer interaction opportunities. Importantly, our software-only approach requires no special or new sensors, either internal or external. As a proof of concept, we use an off-the-shelf Samsung Tablet flashed with a custom kernel. After describing our software pipeline, we report findings from our user study, we conclude with several example applications we built to illustrate the potential of our approach.	pose estimation;  capacitive image;  Hand pose; pose estimation, capacitive image, Hand pose	Choi, Frederick; Mayer, Sven; Harrison, Chris	MobileHCI '21: Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Mobile Human-Computer Interaction	https://doi.org/10.1145/3447526.3472045		1-13	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3447526.3472045,

Of course, human hands are much more sophisticated, able to form rich 3D poses capable of far more complex interactions than poking at a screen. In this paper, we describe how conventional capacitive touchscreens can be used to estimate 3D hand pose, enabling richer interaction opportunities. Importantly, our software-only approach requires no special or new sensors, either internal or external. As a proof of concept, we use an off-the-shelf Samsung Tablet flashed with a custom kernel. After describing our software pipeline, we report findings from our user study, we conclude with several example applications we built to illustrate the potential of our approach."",

152	DTCPS	(Do not) trust in ecosystems	In the context of Smart Ecosystems, systems engage in dynamic cooperation with other systems to achieve their goals. Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior.In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.	virtual evaluation;  smart ecosystems;  malicious behavior;  building trust;  automotive; virtual evaluation, smart ecosystems, malicious behavior, building trust, automotive	Cioroaica, Emilia; Kuhn, Thomas; Buhnova, Barbora	ICSE-NIER '19: Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-NIER.2019.00011		9-12	"""@inproceedings{10.1109/ICSE-NIER.2019.00011,

153	DTCPS	Capturing Autonomy in its Multiple Facets: A Digital Twin Approach	Autonomy has been touted to be a major asset of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and its components. By intertwining non-physical and physical processes they seamlessly integrate interdependent computational and physical components. In this contribution we take a closer look on structural constellations of CPS and their components that refer to autonomy. We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively. Critical elements, such as managing private data in healthcare, can be monitored and adapted to individual needs.	autonomy;  cyber-physical systems;  digital twin;  socio-technical systems design;  subject-orientation; autonomy, cyber-physical systems, digital twin, socio-technical systems design, subject-orientation	Heininger, Richard; Stary, Chris	SAT-CPS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3445969.3450422		3-12	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3445969.3450422,

155	DTCPS	SDCWorks: A Formal Framework for Software Defined Control of Smart Manufacturing Systems	Discrete manufacturing systems are complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) and their availability, performance, and quality have a big impact on the economy. Smart manufacturing promises to improve these aspects. One key approach that is being pursued in this context is the creation of centralized software-defined control (SDC) architectures and strategies that use diverse sensors and data sources to make manufacturing more adaptive, resilient, and programmable. In this paper, we present SDCWorks-a modeling and simulation framework for SDC. It consists of the semantic structures for creating models, a baseline controller, and an open source implementation of a discrete event simulator for SDCWorks models. We provide the semantics of such a manufacturing system in terms of a discrete transition system which sets up the platform for future research in a new class of problems in formal verification, synthesis, and monitoring. We illustrate the expressive power of SDCWorks by modeling the realistic SMART manufacturing testbed of University of Michigan. We show how our open source SDCWorks simulator can be used to evaluate relevant metrics (throughput, latency, and load) for example manufacturing systems.

157	DTCPS	Enabling Trade-offs Between Accuracy and Computational Cost: Adaptive Algorithms to Reduce Time to Clinical Insight	The efficacy of drug treatments depends on how tightly small molecules bind to their target proteins. Quantifying the strength of these interactions (the so called `binding affinity') is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient specific medicine. Recently, evidence from blind challenge predictions and retrospective validation studies has suggested that molecular dynamics (MD) can now achieve useful predictive accuracy ( 1 kcal/mol) This accuracy is sufficient to greatly accelerate hit to lead and lead optimization. To translate these advances in predictive accuracy so as to impact clinical and/or industrial decision making requires that binding free energy results must be turned around on reduced timescales without loss of accuracy. This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and intelligent and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. This work is motivated by the real world problem of providing insight from drug candidate data on a time scale that is as short as possible. Specifically, we reproduce results from a collaborative project between UCL and GlaxoSmithKline to study a congeneric series of drug candidates binding to the BRD4 protein - inhibitors of which have shown promising preclinical efficacy in pathologies ranging from cancer to inflammation. We demonstrate the use of a framework called HTBAC, designed to support the aforementioned requirements of accurate and rapid drug binding affinity calculations. HTBAC facilitates the execution of the numbers of simulations while supporting the adaptive execution of algorithms. Furthermore, HTBAC enables the selection of simulation parameters during runtime which can, in principle, optimize the use of computational resources whilst producing results within a target uncertainty.

    abstract = ""The efficacy of drug treatments depends on how tightly small molecules bind to their target proteins. Quantifying the strength of these interactions (the so called `binding affinity') is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient specific medicine. Recently, evidence from blind challenge predictions and retrospective validation studies has suggested that molecular dynamics (MD) can now achieve useful predictive accuracy ( 1 kcal/mol) This accuracy is sufficient to greatly accelerate hit to lead and lead optimization. To translate these advances in predictive accuracy so as to impact clinical and/or industrial decision making requires that binding free energy results must be turned around on reduced timescales without loss of accuracy. This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and intelligent and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. This work is motivated by the real world problem of providing insight from drug candidate data on a time scale that is as short as possible. Specifically, we reproduce results from a collaborative project between UCL and GlaxoSmithKline to study a congeneric series of drug candidates binding to the BRD4 protein - inhibitors of which have shown promising preclinical efficacy in pathologies ranging from cancer to inflammation. We demonstrate the use of a framework called HTBAC, designed to support the aforementioned requirements of accurate and rapid drug binding affinity calculations. HTBAC facilitates the execution of the numbers of simulations while supporting the adaptive execution of algorithms.

161	DTCPS	D2U: Data Driven User Emulation for the Enhancement of Cyber Testing, Training, and Data Set Generation	Whether testing intrusion detection systems, conducting training exercises, or creating data sets to be used by the broader cybersecurity community, realistic user behavior is a critical component of a cyber range. Existing methods either rely on network level data or replay recorded user actions to approximate real users in a network. Our work produces generative models trained on actual user data (sequences of application usage) collected from endpoints. Once trained to the user's behavioral data, these models can generate novel sequences of actions from the same distribution as the training data. These sequences of actions are then fed to our custom software via configuration files, which replicate those behaviors on end devices. Notably, our models are platform agnostic and could generate behavior data for any emulation software package. In this paper we present our model generation process, software architecture, and an investigation of the fidelity of our models. Specifically, we consider two different representations of the behavioral sequences, on which three standard generative models for sequential data--Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model, and Random Surfer--are employed. Additionally, we examine adding a latent variable to faithfully capture time-of-day trends. Best results are observed when sampling a unique next behavior (regardless of the specific sequential model used) and the duration to take the behavior, paired with the temporal latent variable. Our software is currently deployed in a cyber range to help evaluate the efficacy of defensive cyber technologies, and we suggest additional ways that the cyber community as a whole can benefit from more realistic user behavior emulation.	data driven;  data sets;  experimental infrastructure;  user emulation; data driven, data sets, experimental infrastructure, user emulation	Oesch, Sean; Bridges, Robert A.; Verma, Miki; Weber, Brian; Diallo, Oumar	CSET '21: Proceedings of the 14th Cyber Security Experimentation and Test Workshop	https://doi.org/10.1145/3474718.3475718		17-26	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3474718.3475718,

165	DTCPS	Constructing a digital city on a web-3D platform: simultaneous and consistent generation of metadata and tile data from a multi-source raw dataset	In this study, we develop a platform that can display approximately 20 types of data via a web browser to realize a digital twin of a wider area, including a detailed reading display of block units and individual three-dimensional point cloud data (point cloud) of a city. Using actual data, we examine if the data model and visualization design correspond with the zoom level. Owing to the comparative examination of the wide-area display performance and the map representation design in a JavaScript-based open-source library, we were able to develop a platform with light architecture and an easily customizable display. Furthermore, prototyping, based on Mapbox GL JS and Deck.GL, and the display of spatiotemporal flow layers, such as background maps, point cloud data in many places, dozens of layer display types, and the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) allowed for the seamless transition from the local government to the wide-area display in the prefecture unit in approximately 10-20 s.It is recommended that this digital smart city platform should be standardized by other local governments, especially in areas where higher-order data visualization is yet to advance. To display this digital city in a lightweight environment, we consider the digital data situation of local governments in Japan. It is necessary to define the visualized design for each zoom level according to the characteristics of the data. We then arranged the display model of each zoom level for 20 types of urban infrastructure data related to the digital smart city by referring to the style schema of the tile form. Through these tasks, we organized the commonality and optimization of data models and formats.	infrastructure 3D tiles;  digital city;  Mapbox GL JS;  Deck.GL; infrastructure 3D tiles, digital city, Mapbox GL JS, Deck.GL	Seto, Toshikazu; Sekimoto, Yoshihide; Asahi, Kosuke; Endo, Takahiro	ARIC '20: Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Advances in Resilient and Intelligent Cities	https://doi.org/10.1145/3423455.3430316		1-9	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3423455.3430316,

168	DTCPS	Ensuring a Robust Multimodal Conversational User Interface During Maintenance Work	It has been shown that the provision of a conversational user interface proves beneficial in many domains. But, there are still many challenges when applied in production areas, e.g. as part of a virtual assistant to support workers in knowledge-intensive maintenance work. Regarding input modalities, touchscreens are failure-prone in wet environments and the quality of voice recognition is negatively affected by ambient noise. Augmenting a symmetric text- and voice-based user interface with gestural input poses a good solution to provide both efficiency and a robust communication. This paper contributes to this research area by providing results on the application of appropriate head and one-hand gestures during maintenance work. We conducted an elicitation study with 20 participants and present a gesture set as its outcome. To facilitate the gesture development and integration for application designers, a classification model for head gestures and one for one-hand gestures were developed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for operators' acceptance regarding a multimodal conversational user interface with support of gestural input during maintenance work was demonstrated. It encompasses two usability testings with 18 participants in different realistic, but controlled settings: notebook repair (SUS: 82.1) and cutter head maintenance (SUS: 82.7).	user-defined gestures;  task guidance;  multimodal interface;  industry 4.0;  elicitation study;  conversational agent;  Assistance systems; user-defined gestures, task guidance, multimodal interface, industry 4.0, elicitation study, conversational agent, Assistance systems	Fleiner, Christian; Riedel, Till; Beigl, Michael; Ruoff, Marcel	MuC '21: Proceedings of Mensch und Computer 2021	https://doi.org/10.1145/3473856.3473871		79-91	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3473856.3473871,

171	DTCPS	Digital twin: a machine learning approach to predict individual stress levels in extreme environments	Remote Health Monitoring (RHM) has the potential to increase operational safety in extreme environments. Negative stress exposure influences mission success or the short- and long-term health conditions of deployed personnel. To quantify negative stress, we introduce a washable smart textile with integrated sensors. Analyzing the transmitted sensor values, medical advisors monitor up to 72 sensor values in parallel in case of an average group size of eight people. In order to aggregate the amount of data, we propose a stress level scale that includes stress trends. To predict individual stress levels based on sensor data, environmental quantities and the individual physiological fingerprint, we train different machine learning models. To evaluate such models, we implement a data acquisition environment to label data snapshots. Therefore, we do not need to collect in-field data and expose humans to negative stress. Moreover, we can mock sensor failures and rare, but relevant, sensor value combinations that are difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Our evaluation environment identifies Random Forest Regressor from a set of 25 models to perform best to predict individual stress levels. This model performs 23.19 times better than a zero rule classifier to distinguish among nine stress levels for mission goal health condition and 10.50 times better for mission goal mission success. Finally, we present our current RHM user interface design. It addresses issues such as information overload, avatar sympathy and unnecessary navigation paths.

172	DTCPS	Kalibre: Knowledge-based Neural Surrogate Model Calibration for Data Center Digital Twins	Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to improve its learning efficiency.

    abstract = ""Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on a 32-core processor, Kalibre achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.81degC and 0.75degC in calibrating two CFD models for two production data halls hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes than existing baseline approaches."",

175	DTCPS	How People Distinguish Individuals from their Movements: Toward the Realization of Personalized Agents	Demands for agents that replicate the characteristics of specific individuals are increasing. Although ways to implement personality traits into the virtual agents' movement have been widely researched, ways to create aspects of individuality that can be identified as belonging to specific individuals have not. To clarify how well humans can identify individuals from short movements and what elements of movement contribute to the perception of individuality, we examined the relationship between the degree of confidence in personal identification and statics of gesture movement. In the experiment, participants were asked to compare pairs of short presentation animations and give their degree of confidence that the two animations were of the same person. The animations were created with motion data from performers and with 3D-CG characters to reduce the differences in appearances and shot angles. We calculated five expressivity parameters from the wrist movement for each gesture and compared the answers from the participants. The results showed that the participants were able to distinguish individuals doing the same action and recognize the individuals by the spatial and temporal extents of their movement, which were represented by how much space they use and how fast they moved their wrists. This study clarifies the cognitive aspects of what elements need to be reproduced to develop agents with individuality.

The model incorporates the real-time ECG signal from the body-worn sensors to estimate exercise level and compute cardiac variables like left ventricular dynamics, cardiac output, ejection fraction, mean arterial pressure, etc., of an individual while performing exercises. The novel contribution of this work is to determine the cardiac compliances from the morphology of the single-lead ECG signal and Systemic resistance estimation from the information of the exercise level for a specific subject performing physical activities. Simulation results are produced employing an open-source database (Troika), and it shows medically accepted trends in all the derived cardiac variables.

178	DTCPS	Distributed Approaches to Supply Chain Simulation: A Review	The field of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is experiencing rapid strides in the use of Industry 4.0 technologies and the conceptualization of new supply chain configurations for online retail, sustainable and green supply chains, and the Circular Economy. Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.

180	DTCPS	SMARTLAGOON: Innovative modelling approaches for predicting socio-environmental evolution in highly anthropized coastal lagoons	Coastal lagoons are ecosystems with significant environmental and socio-economic value. However, these natural systems are especially vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic pressures, such as intensive agriculture and extensive urbanization as a consequence of the tourist development. Despite the vulnerability and complexity of these ecosystems, there has been limited development of novel techniques which can provide real-time monitoring, analysis and management of these critical resources. Beyond being useful for policy-making procedures at multiple levels of granularity, such tools can increase local and citizen awareness of environmental impacts. This paper introduces the key concept behind the SMARTLAGOON project, which intends to develop a digital twin to build a systemic understanding of the socio-environmental inter-relationships affecting coastal lagoons and their ecosystem. Particularly, we focus on the main research activities carried out since the beginning of the project (January 1st, 2021), which are mainly based on initial mapping and reporting of the main stakeholders' needs and wishes in relation to the technological products to be developed in SMARTLAGOON. This will onset the initial development pathway, while additional stakeholder inputs during the project lifetime will help to further explore and prioritize the key developments, thus maximizing the relevance and impact of the Mar Menor's digital twin.

Based on the current mature Internet technology, this paper introduces the concept of the Industrial Internet information model into the fault diagnosis of wind turbines and realizes the intelligentization of fault diagnosis of wind turbines. At the same time, the feasibility analysis of this scheme was carried out by studying the existing related cases. The results show that the information model has a stronger application prospect in the fault diagnosis of wind turbines. Compared with traditional methods, the new solution proposed in this paper makes the operation and maintenance and diagnosis of wind turbines more ideal.

183	DTCPS	Open3DGen: open-source software for reconstructing textured 3D models from RGB-D images	This paper presents the first entirely open-source and cross-platform software called Open3DGen for reconstructing photorealistic textured 3D models from RGB-D images. The proposed software pipeline consists of nine main stages: 1) RGB-D acquisition; 2) 2D feature extraction; 3) camera pose estimation; 4) point cloud generation; 5) coarse mesh reconstruction; 6) optional loop closure; 7) fine mesh reconstruction; 8) UV unwrapping; and 9) texture projection. This end-to-end scheme combines multiple state-of-the-art techniques and provides an easy-to-use software package for real-time 3D model reconstruction and offline texture mapping. The main innovation lies in various Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques that are used with additional depth data to yield high-quality 3D models in real-time and at low cost. The functionality of Open3DGen has been validated on AMD Ryzen 3900X CPU and Nvidia GTX1080 GPU. This proof-of-concept setup attains an average processing speed of 15 fps for 720p (1280x720) RGBD input without the offline backend. Our solution is shown to provide competitive 3D mesh quality and execution performance with the state-of-the-art commercial and academic solutions.	texture mapping;  point cloud generation;  mesh reconstruction;  feature extraction;  camera pose estimation;  RGB-D acquisition;  3D model reconstruction; texture mapping, point cloud generation, mesh reconstruction, feature extraction, camera pose estimation, RGB-D acquisition, 3D model reconstruction	Niemirepo, Teo T.; Viitanen, Marko; Vanne, Jarno	MMSys '21: Proceedings of the 12th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference	https://doi.org/10.1145/3458305.3463374		12-22	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3458305.3463374,

188	DTCPS	Event Prediction in the Big Data Era: A Systematic Survey	Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either our society or the nature, such as earthquakes, civil unrest, system failures, pandemics, and crimes. It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.

189	DTCPS	Model-based clinical assist system for cardiac ablation	"Cardiac Ablation is an effective treatment of arrhythmia in which physicians terminate fast heart rate by transecting abnormal electrical conduction pathways in the heart with RF energy. During the procedure, physicians diagnose the condition of the heart and locate ablation sites by analyzing electrical signals sensed by catheters inserted into the heart. Due to the limited observation of the patient's heart, there may exist multiple heart conditions that can explain historical observations, causing ambiguities in the patient's heart condition. During the procedure, physicians have to visualize and continuously update these suspected heart conditions in their mind, causing heavy mental burden on the physicians.

    abstract = {Cardiac Ablation is an effective treatment of arrhythmia in which physicians terminate fast heart rate by transecting abnormal electrical conduction pathways in the heart with RF energy. During the procedure, physicians diagnose the condition of the heart and locate ablation sites by analyzing electrical signals sensed by catheters inserted into the heart. Due to the limited observation of the patient's heart, there may exist multiple heart conditions that can explain historical observations, causing ambiguities in the patient's heart condition. During the procedure, physicians have to visualize and continuously update these suspected heart conditions in their mind, causing heavy mental burden on the physicians. In this paper, cardiac electrophysiology is formalized using a physiological model of the heart, such that the diagnosis problem during cardiac ablation can be formalized as parameter identification and state estimation problems with the heart model.

191	DTCPS	Hybrid Approach for Digital Twins in the Built Environment	In recent years, several countries have created policies to enforce Zero Energy Building (ZEB) standards for new building construction. Achieving this for new buildings is feasible, but it may be difficult to transform existing buildings to ZEBs. Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment. A case study for a digital twin of a single room is also discussed. The initial comparison of cooling energy between the physical testbed and the DT model shows promising results for future development.

192	DTCPS	An anomaly detection framework for digital twin driven cyber-physical systems	In recent years, the digital twin has been one of the active research areas in modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Both the digital twin and its physical counterpart, called a plant, are highly intertwined such that they continuously exchange data to reveal useful information about the overall system. Such class of CPSs need to be robust to various types of disturbances, such as faulty sensors and model discrepancies, since the interplay between the physical plant's operation and digital twin's simulation may lead to undesirable or even destructive effect. To address this problem, this paper introduces a flexible anomaly detection framework for monitoring anomalous behaviours in digital twin based CPSs. In particular, our approach integrates both the digital twin and data-driven techniques that detect and classify anomalous behaviours due to modelling errors (e.g. incomplete models) and sensor and physical system's faults. The framework can be deployed to any general CPSs without the full knowledge of the digital twin's internal model. Therefore, our method is amenable to various types of digital twin implementations that enhance the traditional data-driven anomaly detection mechanism. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process model. The experimental result shows our approach is able to effectively detect and classify anomaly sources from the physical plant, sensor and digital twin, even in the situation when a certain combination of multiple anomalies occur simultaneously.	discrepancy monitoring;  digital twin;  cyber-physical system;  anomaly detection; discrepancy monitoring, digital twin, cyber-physical system, anomaly detection	Gao, Chuanchao; Park, Heejong; Easwaran, Arvind	ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3450267.3450533		44-54	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3450267.3450533,

194	DTCPS	Flexibility Management of Data Centers to Provide Energy Services in the Smart Grid	In this paper, we address the problem of Data Centers (DCs) energy efficiency considering their integration into the electrical and thermal grids by emphasizing the role of the DC Digital Twin model in DC flexibility management. Due to their high digitization and controllable energy systems, the DCs can act as flexible assets, being able to dynamically adapt their energy profiles and valuable energy services. We present a flexibility management solution that is using a Digital Twin model of DC systems to determine action plans for shifting energy load. DC monitored data is acquired by integration with existing DC infrastructure management (DCIM) while energy predictions are computed for DC energy demand, energy flexibility, and heat generation. The flexibility optimization plans for DC operation are determined and enforced after DC manager validation via DCIM integration. Five energy services are identified as suitable to be provided by the DC with the help of described flexibility management solution: energy trading for increasing profit, grid congestion management by decreasing DC energy demand, scheduling by increasing DC energy demand to consume as much as possible the renewable available in the local grid, power factor compensation and sell heat on demand.

196	DTCPS	Neural Network Modeling as a Method for Creating Digital Twins: From Industry 4.0 to Industry 4.1	Digital twins are one of the key technologies behind the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In the coming years they will be introduced on a large scale in the industry and in other spheres. A wide range of digital twins will be in demand: from separate components to complex technical facilities, such as automobiles, airplanes, manufacturing lines, factories, corporations, etc. To provide their successful interaction, it is important to create digital twins on the uniform principles. Currently, creating a digital twin is a complex scientific issue. It presents difficulties because it is necessary not only to describe physical (or chemical, biological, etc.) processes going on in the object, but also to envisage significant changes of its properties in the course of its operation. In this case the digital twin is supposed to adapt to the changes in the original object in accordance with the data received from the sensors.The aim of the research was to define the strategies of solving the current problems in such areas as digital twins, the internet of things and cyberphysical systems.In order to achieve this aim, the following problems were supposed to be solved:- Consider the definitions of the digital twin suggested in the world scientific literature- Find a unified data-driven real-time approach to creating digital twins- Suggest using the neural network approach in creating digital twins.During the use of the modelled object, specifics of the physical processes going on in it and object properties can change. The model is supposed to adapt in accordance with these changes, which is rather difficult if a model is generated by applying computer-aided engineering software packages (CAE) based on classical numerical methods.We consider the multistage technique as more promising. It involves building an adaptive model at the second stage. Such a model can be specified and redesigned based on real-time data. Since neural networks have proved to be efficient in solving complicated problems related to data processing, we recommend using them as the basic class of mathematical models for creating digital twins.	neural network modelling;  mathematical model;  digital twins;  data set;  Industry 4.0; neural network modelling, mathematical model, digital twins, data set, Industry 4.0	Dashkina, Alexandra; Khalyapina, Ludmila; Kobicheva, Aleksandra; Lazovskaya, Tatiana; Malykhina, Galina; Tarkhov, Dmitriy	SPBPU IDE '20: Proceedings of the 2nd International Scientific Conference on Innovations in Digital Economy	https://doi.org/10.1145/3444465.3444535		1-5	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3444465.3444535,

The starting point for the investigation was the observation that physiotherapists are bricoleurs--that is, practitioners who are skillful in creatively using the available materials in their environment. We conducted co-design workshops with physiotherapists that informed the development of a prototype toolkit, the ExerTiles, comprising a set of interactive tiles with control components. The toolkit was assessed by seven physiotherapists who created balance training exercises for two older adults each. Post-test interviews revealed that all the physiotherapists were highly positive toward using the ExerTiles as part of their professional work. The following five factors contributed toward the acceptance of ExerTiles by the physiotherapists: tailorability, versatile training, creativity, fun, and portability. Our research indicates that tangible interactive technology has a strong potential to integrate with and add value to physiotherapy practice.

200	DTCPS	Multi-scale Modelling of Urban Air Pollution with Coupled Weather Forecast and Traffic Simulation on HPC Architecture	Urban air pollution is one of the global challenges to which over 3 million deaths are attributable yearly. Traffic is emitting over 40\% of several contaminants, like NO2 [10]. The directive 2008/50/EC of the European Commission prescribes the assessment air quality by accumulating exceedance of contamination concentration limits over a one-year period using measurement stations, which may be supplemented by modeling techniques to provide adequate information on spatial distribution. Computational models do predict that small scale spatial fluctuation is expected on the street level: local air flow phenomena can cluster up pollutants or carry them away far from the location of emission [2]. The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus also interacts with urban air quality. Regions in lock down have highly reduced air pollution strain due to the drop of traffic [4]. Also, correlation between the fatality rate of a previous respiratory disease, SARS 2002, and Air Pollution Index suggests that bad air quality may double fatality rate [6]. At street level pollution dispersion highly depends on the daily weather, a one-year simulation low time scale model is needed. Additionally, to resolve street-level phenomena a cell size of 1 to 4 meters are utilized in these regions that requires CFD methods to use a simulation domain of 1 to 100 million cells. Memory and computational requirements for these tasks are enormous, so HPC architecture is needed to have reasonable results within a manageable time frame. To tackle this challenge, the Urban Air Pollution (UAP) workflow is developed as a pilot of the HiDALGO project [7], which is funded by the H2020 framework of the European Union. The pilot is designed in a modular way with the mindset to be developed into a digital twin model later. Its standardized interfaces enable multiple software to be used in a specific module. At its core, a traffic simulation implemented in SUMO is coupled with a CFD simulation. Currently OpenFOAM (v1906, v1912 and v2006) and Ansys Fluent (v19.2) are supported. This presentation focuses on the OpenFOAM implementation, as it proved more feasible and scalable on most HPC architectures. The incompressible unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier- Stokes equations are solved with the PIMPLE method, Courant-number based adaptive time stepping and transient atmospheric boundary conditions. The single component NOx-type pollution is calculated independently as a scalar with transport equations along the flow field. Pollution emission is treated as a per cell volumetric source that changes in time. The initial condition is obtained from a steady state solution at the initial time with the SIMPLE method, using the identical, but stationary boundary conditions and source fields. Custom modules are developed for proper boundary condition and source term handling. The UAP workflow supports automatic 3D air flow geometry and traffic network generation from OpenStreetMap data. Ground and building information are used for geometry, road network for traffic, and further assets for visualization. The CFD 3D mesh generation is done by either an in-house octree-mesh generator, or the snappyHexMesh utility from OpenFOAM. Meteorological data for boundary conditions are acquired from ECMWF using the Polytope REST API [5] automatically for the user specified day and location. The values at the closes grid point is selected, transformed into the Euclidean coordinate system, and converted OpenFOAM readable file format. A custom OpenFOAM module ensures the proper handling of the altitude and time dependent boundary field. Background air quality data is acquired from the Copernicus AMS [3]. Results are validated against a local air quality sensor network which is under expansion for more accuracy. Traffic simulation or data can be obtained from external sources. For the pilot, a traffic sensor network of camera and loop detectors are installed in the Hungarian city of Gy\H{o}r. Sensory data is transmitted real time and is to be coupled into the simulation directly. Random traffic generation is also supported. Emission is computed by an in-house tool from traffic simulation results in SUMO data file format by applying the Copert model, interpolated to the CFD mesh and stored to an OpenFOAM readable file format. A custom OpenFOAM module is responsible for the timely read of this source term data and the proper adjustments on the equations. Calculation of the wind flow and the pollution dispersion is the most computationally heavy part of the workflow, as input file generation and traffic simulation top at 60 and 20 minutes on one node, respectively, for one day, in comparison to the minimum 2 hours for the smallest cell count CFD model. For benchmarking purposes, only the runtime of a small portion (15-60 minutes) of the scalable part of the OpenFOAM simulation is measured for the transient and 600 iterations for the steady state simulation. Primary benchmarks are issued on the local cluster PLEXI (18 node 2x6 core Intel X5650, 48GB RAM, 40Gb InfiniBand) with additional investigations on EAGLE (PSNC, Poznan, 1119 node 2x14 core Intel E5-2697v3, 64GB RAM, 56Gb InfiniBand) and the HAWK Test System (HLRS, Stuttgart, 5632 node 2x128 core AMD EPYC 7742, 256GB RAM, 200 Gb InfiniBand HDR200). Tuning OpenFOAM settings with optimized IO, multilevel decomposition and cell index renumbering improved speedup on PLEXI from 18 to 102 for the 1M cell count and from 49 to 77 on the 9M cell count model at 216 cores. On the HAWK Test System, speedups top at 133 for 1M and 401 for 9M cells, both at 2048 cores. On EAGLE, the 1M cell count model tops speedup at 104 at 448 cores. Saturating effect at one node core count suggests memory bandwidth limited calculations. Full day simulation runs were also done for areas within 5 cities (Gy\H{o}r, Madrid, Stuttgart, Herrenberg and Graz) with random traffic and different mesh sizes of ca. 0.8M and ca. 3M cells. The runtime of the full CFD module on PLEXI at 48 cores in 2.7 and 20 hours on average for the smaller and larger cell count, respectively. This puts the one-year simulation within reach for coarse meshes on PLEXI and finer meshes on the more powerful HPC architectures. Due to a high core count to memory channel ratio for AMD processors, poor single node parallel efficiency is expected on memory bandwidth limited applications, which supports our present findings, and are comparable with speedup results of other CFD software on the same hardware [9]. Node based speedup of certain OpenFOAM simulations, however, may show superlinear behavior [1]. In conclusion, the UAP workflow and the OpenFOAM implementation of the CFD module are on good track for reaching the goal of simulating one year within a manageable time frame. The few hours long simulation time for one day's pollution also makes the current version feasible for forecasting. Future work includes using proper orthogonal decomposition, POD[8], which is a model order reduction method for eventually improving calculation time drastically while sacrificing limited accuracy. We also plan testing and benchmarking GPGPU based solvers, implementing reaction for pollutants and extend validation using new air quality measuring stations.	coupled simulation;  Urban scale;  CFD;  Air pollution; coupled simulation, Urban scale, CFD, Air pollution	Kornyei, Laszlo; Horvath, Zoltan; Ruopp, Andreas; Kovacs, Akos; Liszkai, Bence	HPCAsia '21 Companion: The International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region Companion	https://doi.org/10.1145/3440722.3440917		9-10	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3440722.3440917,

201	DTCPS	Towards an Ontology Representing Characteristics of Inflammatory Bowel Disease	"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease characterized by numerous, hard to predict periods of relapse and remission. ""Digital twin"" approaches, leveraging personalized predictive models, would significantly enhance therapeutic decision-making and cost-effectiveness. However, the associated computational and statistical methods require high quality data from a large population of patients. Such a comprehensive repository is very challenging to build, though, and none is available for IBD. To overcome this, a promising approach is to employ a knowledge graph, which is built from the available data and would help predicting IBD episodes and delivering more relevant personalized therapy at the lowest cost. In this research, we present a knowledge graph developed on the basis of patient records which are collected from one of the largest German gastroentologic outpatient clinic. First, we designed IBD ontology that encompasses the vocabulary, specifications and characteristics associated by physicians with IBD patients, such as disease classification schemas (e.g., Montreal Classification of IBD), status of the disease activity, and medications.

    abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease characterized by numerous, hard to predict periods of relapse and remission. ""Digital twin"" approaches, leveraging personalized predictive models, would significantly enhance therapeutic decision-making and cost-effectiveness. However, the associated computational and statistical methods require high quality data from a large population of patients. Such a comprehensive repository is very challenging to build, though, and none is available for IBD. To overcome this, a promising approach is to employ a knowledge graph, which is built from the available data and would help predicting IBD episodes and delivering more relevant personalized therapy at the lowest cost. In this research, we present a knowledge graph developed on the basis of patient records which are collected from one of the largest German gastroentologic outpatient clinic. First, we designed IBD ontology that encompasses the vocabulary, specifications and characteristics associated by physicians with IBD patients, such as disease classification schemas (e.g., Montreal Classification of IBD), status of the disease activity, and medications. Next, we defined the mappings between ontology entities and database variables. Physicians and project members participating in the Fraunhofer MED2ICIN project, validated the ontology and the knowledge graph. Furthermore, the knowledge graph has been validated against the competency questions compiled by physicians.},

205	DTCPS	Formally verified FMI enabled external data broker: rabbitmq FMU	Automated monitoring of deployed Cyber-physical Systems while they are operating can assist in detecting misbehavior. One way to achieve such monitoring is via co-simulation of a modelled system that corresponds to the deployed system. A necessary element in the realization of such a concept is data brokering between the systems. Our work addresses the topic of brokering external data into an Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) 2.0 enabled co-simulation via a Functional Mock-up Unit (a simulation unit) called RabbitMQ FMU that outputs messages from an external message queue into the FMI enabled co-simulation.Our contribution includes a formal specification that captures the semantics of RabbitMQ FMU and ensures a maximum delay on the messages relayed to the co-simulation even through an unreliable network. This formal specification is then used to generate test cases that exercise all states and transitions of the formal specification. The implementation is then subjected to these test cases to verify that it is a refinement of the specification. The verification procedure is ongoing and currently the implementation has successfully been subjected to 1,539,246 tests. The RabbitMQ FMU provides a general and self-contained solution to brokering external data into and FMI-enabled co-simulation with guaranteed delays.	self-adaptive systems;  functional mock-up interface;  formal verification;  digital twins;  co-simulation; self-adaptive systems, functional mock-up interface, formal verification, digital twins, co-simulation	Thule, Casper; Gomes, Cl\'{a}udio; Lausdahl, Kenneth G.

Co-simulation plays a key role in this by allowing the system as a whole to be simulated by composing simulations of its parts. The ability to do this coupling relies on the models adhering to a well-defined interface.

211	DTCPS	Real-time Multi-agent-based Decision-making Approach for Dynamic Machine Tool Selection Problem	With the development of information communication technology, intelligent manufacturing is one of the trends of manufacturing industry. Machine tool should be digital and intelligent, providing some manufacturing service via the Internet of Things. In order to solve the dynamic machine tool selection (DMTS), this paper proposes a novel decision-making approach based on real-time multi-agent. Firstly, the machine tool digital twin (MTDT) is introduced to provide real-time device data for evaluating machine tools. Based on MTDT, a real-time multi-agent-based mechanism (RTMAM) is designed for solving DMTS. Then based on exponential scale, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is modified for calculating the weight of evaluation index. The evaluation model of machine tool is solved by Reference Ideal Method (RIM). Finally, the proposed decision-making approach for DMTS is tested in an aviation plant.

212	DTCPS	TwinOps - DevOps meets model-based engineering and digital twins for the engineering of CPS	The engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) requires a large set of expertise to capture the system requirements and to derive a correct solution. Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS.In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow. TwinOps illustrates how to leverage several best practices in MBE and DevOps for the engineering Cyber-Physical systems. We illustrate our contribution using a Digital Twins case study to illustrate TwinOps benefits, combining AADL and Modelica models, and an IoT platform.

213	DTCPS	Towards a digital twin for cyber-physical production systems: a multi-paradigm modeling approach in the postal industry	This paper presents our early-stage research on a Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) approach as an initial step towards the definition of a Digital Twin (DT) for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.	multi-paradigm modeling;  digital twin;  cyber-physical production systems;  business process modeling;  agent-based modeling;  activity modeling; multi-paradigm modeling, digital twin, cyber-physical production systems, business process modeling, agent-based modeling, activity modeling	Niati, Asmaa; Selma, Cyrine; Tamzalit, Dalila; Bruneliere, Hugo; Mebarki, Nasser; Cardin, Olivier	MODELS '20: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.1145/3417990.3421438		1-7	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3417990.3421438,

By introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0, CPSs are used in an interconnected way each of which may belong to a different stakeholder, building a complex System of Systems (SoS) called CPSoS. These systems need to employ some techniques to transform the collected data to knowledge with which the system can make better decisions.

217	DTCPS	Integrating digital twin security simulations in the security operations center	While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.	digital twin;  security framework;  security information and event management;  security operations center; digital twin, security framework, security information and event management, security operations center	"Dietz, Marietheres; Vielberth, Manfred; Pernul, G\""{u}nther"	ARES '20: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	https://doi.org/10.1145/3407023.3407039		1-9	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3407023.3407039,

The faulty implementations resulted in a lax security posture facilitating potential compromise in many areas of the software development environment. We discuss each of the faulty implementations in detail and provide recommendations to avoid in future engagements. The main lesson learned was the organization's inability to strictly adhere to DevSecOps principles resulted in a dysfunctional software development environment and a reduced security posture.	system security;  software security;  software factory;  DevSecOps; system security, software security, software factory, DevSecOps	Morales, Jose Andre; Scanlon, Thomas P.; Volkmann, Aaron; Yankel, Joseph; Yasar, Hasan	ARES '20: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	https://doi.org/10.1145/3407023.3409186		1-8	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3407023.3409186,

220	DTCPS	Integration of Lean Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: A Conceptual Framework	Lean manufacturing has been the primary approach for creating highly efficient manufacturing processes since the early 1990s. It may be very successful due to its effectiveness in reducing complexity and heading off unnecessary works or waste. At present, the term Industry 4.0 depicts a vision of the future manufacturing system. Previous researches indicate the possibility to integrate and combine the lean approach and industry 4.0 system. Previous researches suggest that there are positive relationships between the two concepts. Besides, they conclude that integrating the lean approach and industry 4.0 leads to a greater cost reduction than implementing only one of them. The current paper summarizes and proposes a conceptual framework that can guide the implementation of the integration of lean manufacturing and industry 4.0.

221	DTCPS	Corsican Twin: Authoring In Situ Augmented Reality Visualisations in Virtual Reality	We introduce Corsican Twin, a tool for authoring augmented reality data visualisations in virtual reality using digital twins. The system provides users with the contextual information necessary to design embedded and situated data visualisations in a safe and convenient remote setting. We created system via a co-design process which involved people with little or no programming experience. Using the system, we illustrate three potential use cases for situated visualizations in the context of building maintenance, including: (1) on-site equipment debugging and diagnosis; (2) remote incident playback; and (3) operations simulations for future buildings. From feedback gathered during formative evaluations of our prototype tool with domain experts, we discuss implications, opportunities, and challenges for future in situ visualisation design tools.

233	DTCPS	Evaluating Cascading Impact of Attacks on Resilience of Industrial Control Systems: A Design-Centric Modeling Approach	A design-centric modeling approach was proposed to model the behaviour of the physical processes controlled by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and study the cascading impact of data-oriented attacks. A threat model was used as input to guide the construction of the CPS model where control components which are within the adversary's intent and capabilities are extracted. The relevant control components are subsequently modeled together with their control dependencies and operational design specifications. The approach was demonstrated and validated on a water treatment testbed. Attacks were simulated on the testbed model where its resilience to attacks was evaluated using proposed metrics such as Impact Ratio and Time-to-Critical-State. From the analysis of the attacks, design strengths and weaknesses were identified and design improvements were recommended to increase the testbed's resilience to attacks.	security evaluation;  resilience engineering;  dynamical systems modeling;  cyber-physical systems security;  cascading impact of attacks; security evaluation, resilience engineering, dynamical systems modeling, cyber-physical systems security, cascading impact of attacks	Hau, Zhongyuan; Castellanos, John Henry; Zhou, Jianying	CPSS '20: Proceedings of the 6th ACM on Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop	https://doi.org/10.1145/3384941.3409587		42-53	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3384941.3409587,

Further, current methods for estimating energy consumption and population cannot provide fine enough temporal or spatial granularity for a reasonable personal energy footprint estimate.

237	DTCPS	AC-ROS: assurance case driven adaptation for the robot operating system	Cyber-physical systems that implement self-adaptive behavior, such as autonomous robots, need to ensure that requirements remain satisfied across run-time adaptations. The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.	self-adaptive systems;  robot operating system;  goal structuring notation;  digital twin;  cyber-physical systems;  assurance case; self-adaptive systems, robot operating system, goal structuring notation, digital twin, cyber-physical systems, assurance case	Cheng, Betty H.

    abstract = ""Cyber-physical systems that implement self-adaptive behavior, such as autonomous robots, need to ensure that requirements remain satisfied across run-time adaptations. The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle."",

Real-time key information and awareness is presented in augmented reality (AR) by using interactive visual elements and auditive instructions. This paper describes a solution running on smartphones by using spatial computing capabilities for positional determination, tracking the user movements over the environment space. Besides the user-friendly minimalistic visual interface, the system is also able to instruct, guiding a completely blind person from a start position into a certain destination, avoiding obstacles.

240	DTCPS	Towards creation of a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems	With progressing digitalization and the trend towards autonomous computing, systems tend to form digital ecosystems, where each autonomous system aims at achieving its own goals.Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that.In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem.	automotive smart ecosystem;  collaborative embedded systems;  digital ecosystems;  reference architecture;  smart ecosystems;  smart grid;  software ecosystems; automotive smart ecosystem, collaborative embedded systems, digital ecosystems, reference architecture, smart ecosystems, smart grid, software ecosystems	Cioroaica, Emilia; Chren, Stanislav; Buhnova, Barbora; Kuhn, Thomas; Dimitrov, Dimitar	ECSA '19: Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Software Architecture - Volume 2	https://doi.org/10.1145/3344948.3344973		273-276	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3344948.3344973,

The blinking of an LED can be induced on a virtual 3D model (digital twin) of the machine by a remote expert using a virtual reality application to draw the local worker's attention to certain areas.

In its various forms, it has the potential to disrupt most aspects of human life. Yet, the discourse around AI has long been by experts and for experts. In this paper, we argue for a participatory approach towards designing human-AI interactions.

We then provide insights into our findings and share our lessons learned regarding our workshop topic - AI and Space - our process, and our research. We learned that involving non-experts in complex technical discourses - such as AI - through the structural rigour of design methodology is a viable approach.

246	DTCPS	Classification of Indoor Point Clouds Using Multiviews	We present an approach for classifying 3D point clouds of indoor environments using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image analysis for entropy-selected 3D views. Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects. We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications.

    abstract = ""We present an approach for classifying 3D point clouds of indoor environments using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image analysis for entropy-selected 3D views. Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects. We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications."",

250	DTCPS	A service-oriented approach for classifying 3D points clouds by example of office furniture classification	The rapid digitalization of the Facility Management (FM) sector has increased the demand for mobile, interactive analytics approaches concerning the operational state of a building. These approaches provide the key to increasing stakeholder engagement associated with Operation and Maintenance (O&M) procedures of living and working areas, buildings, and other built environment spaces. We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology.	3D point clouds;  BIM;  indoor models;  machine-learning;  service-oriented; 3D point clouds, BIM, indoor models, machine-learning, service-oriented	"Stojanovic, Vladeta; Trapp, Matthias; Richter, Rico; D\""{o}llner, J\""{u}rgen"	Web3D '18: Proceedings of the 23rd International ACM Conference on 3D Web Technology	https://doi.org/10.1145/3208806.3208810		1-9	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3208806.3208810,

252	DTCPS	Optimizing carbon tax for decentralized electricity markets using an agent-based model	Averting the effects of anthropogenic climate change requires a transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon technology. A way to achieve this is to decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further efforts must be made in other fields such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a low-carbon alternative. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an efficient way to aid in this transition.In this paper, we demonstrate how to to find optimal carbon tax policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a range of carbon taxes to suit differing objectives.Our results show that we are able to minimize electricity cost to below PS10/MWh as well as carbon intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy, we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above PS81/tCO2 for every year. The mean carbon tax strategy was PS240/tCO2.	policy;  optimization;  genetic algorithm;  electricity market model;  digital twin;  climate change;  carbon tax;  agent-based models;  Energy markets; policy, optimization, genetic algorithm, electricity market model, digital twin, climate change, carbon tax, agent-based models, Energy markets	Kell, Alexander J.

Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83\% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.	wireless security;  machine learning;  internet of things;  data fusion;  adversarial machine learning; wireless security, machine learning, internet of things, data fusion, adversarial machine learning	Luo, Zhengping; Zhao, Shangqing; Lu, Zhuo; Sagduyu, Yalin E.; Xu, Jie	WiseML '20: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Wireless Security and Machine Learning	https://doi.org/10.1145/3395352.3402619		13-18	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3395352.3402619,

255	DTCPS	Systematization of Digital Twins: Ontology and Conceptual Framework	The development and progress in information and communication technologies will transform traditional products into smart products and allow to offer novel smart services [1]. Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) <<Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?>>, b) <<What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?>> and c) <<How do these different specifications relate to each other?>> The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders. The holistic view on the data resource dimension further allows to easily deduct the needed data for certain applications or deduct possible applications from already available data.	systematization;  ontology;  conceptual framework;  Digital Twin; systematization, ontology, conceptual framework, Digital Twin	Barth, Linard; Ehrat, Matthias; Fuchs, Rainer; Haarmann, Jens	ICISS '20: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3388176.3388209		13-23	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3388176.3388209,

258	DTCPS	On the Engineering of IoT-Intensive Digital Twin Software Systems	Digital Twins (DT) are software systems representing different aspects of a physical or conceptual counterpart---the real twin, which is instrumented with several sensors or computing devices that generate, consume and transfer data to its DT with different purposes. In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.

260	DTCPS	Expecting the unexpected: developing autonomous-system design principles for reacting to unpredicted events and conditions	When developing autonomous systems, engineers and other stakeholders make great efforts to prepare the system for all foreseeable circumstances. However, such systems are still bound to encounter situations that were not considered at design time. For reasons like safety, cost, or ethics it is often highly desired that these new cases be handled correctly upon first encounter. In this paper, we first justify our position that there will always exist unpredicted events and conditions, driven by, e.g., new inventions in the real world, the diversity of world-wide system deployments and uses, and the possibility that multiple events that were unforeseen at design time (or overlooked, or knowingly abandoned following cost-benefit-risk calculations) will not only occur, but will occur together. We then argue that despite the unpredictability, handling such situations is indeed possible. Hence, we offer and exemplify design principles, which, when applied in advance, can improve the system's ability to deal with unpredicted situations. We conclude with a discussion of how this work and a much-needed thorough study of the unexpected can contribute toward a foundation of engineering principles for developing trustworthy next-generation autonomous systems.	unpredictable circumstances;  unexpected events;  trustworthiness;  systems engineering;  software engineering;  robustness;  autonomous systems; unpredictable circumstances, unexpected events, trustworthiness, systems engineering, software engineering, robustness, autonomous systems	Marron, Assaf; Limonad, Lior; Pollack, Sarah; Harel, David	SEAMS '20: Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM 15th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3387939.3391607		167-173	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3387939.3391607,

261	DTCPS	Cloud-Based Battery Digital Twin Middleware Using Model-Based Development	Following the trends of electrification, the energy storage of vehicles is gaining importance as the most expensive part of an electric car. Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed.

267	DTCPS	Towards a Generalized System for Generative Engineering	Product design based on mechanical performance requirements and with given boundary conditions is a frequent and demanding engineering problem. In most cases, effectiveness of the design is limited to expertise of the respective designer, which also results in inefficient and incomplete exploration of the product's design space. With a large amount of data available and recent advancements in hardware technology, data-driven methods have become an increasingly common strategy for problems that are difficult to formulate or expensive to solve by creating a physical model, but such methods often lack the application perspective; they are not yet widely applied especially in engineering product development. Generative design (here, more precisely generative engineering) is one such technique which has recently gained importance. Although many preliminary studies demonstrate plausible results from data-driven generative design approaches, a closeloop-3D-generative-design-pipeline that achieves full automation and optimization of the design with respect to the product's functional requirements is still in its nascent stage. This paper proposes a generalized hybrid framework comprised of both data-based and physics-based methods to achieve this objective, as represented by the teaser figure 1.

270	DTCPS	A fog computing framework for autonomous driving assist: architecture, experiments, and challenges	Autonomous driving is expected to provide a range of far-reaching economic, environmental and safety benefits. In this study, we propose a fog computing based framework to assist autonomous driving. Our framework relies on overhead views from cameras and data streams from vehicle sensors to create a network of distributed digital twins, called an edge twin, on fog machines. The edge twin will be continuously updated with the locations of both autonomous and human-piloted vehicles on the road segments. The vehicle locations will be harvested from overhead cameras as well as location feeds from the vehicles themselves. Although the edge twin can make fair road space allocations from a global viewpoint, there is a communication cost (delay) in reaching it from the cameras and vehicular sensors. To address this, we introduce a machine learning forecaster as a part of the edge twin which is responsible for predicting the future location of vehicles. Lastly, we introduce a box algorithm that will use the forecasted values to create a hazard map for the road segment which would be used by the framework to suggest safe manoeuvres for the autonomous vehicles such as lane changes and accelerations. We present the complete fog computing framework for autonomous driving assist and evaluate key portions of the proposed framework using simulations based on a real-world dataset of vehicle position traces on a highway.	machine learning;  fog computing;  edge twin;  autonomous driving; machine learning, fog computing, edge twin, autonomous driving	Maheswaran, Muthucumaru; Yang, Tianzi; Memon, Salman	CASCON '19: Proceedings of the 29th Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering	https://doi.org/10.5555/3370272.3370275		24-33	"""@inproceedings{10.5555/3370272.3370275,

272	DTCPS	OCoR: An Overlapping-Aware Code Retriever	"Code retrieval helps developers reuse code snippets in the opensource projects. Given a natural language description, code retrieval aims to search for the most relevant code relevant among a set of code snippets. Existing state-of-the-art approaches apply neural networks to code retrieval. However, these approaches still fail to capture an important feature: overlaps. The overlaps between different names used by different people indicate that two different names may be potentially related (e.g., ""message"" and ""msg""), and the overlaps between identifiers in code and words in natural language descriptions indicate that the code snippet and the description may potentially be related. To address this problem, we propose a novel neural architecture named OCoR1, where we introduce two specifically-designed components to capture overlaps: the first embeds names by characters to capture the overlaps between names, and the second introduces a novel overlap matrix to represent the degrees of overlaps between each natural language word and each identifier. The evaluation was conducted on two established datasets. The experimental results show that OCoR significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves 13.1% to 22.3% improvements.

The two main features of such systems are: (1) They can automatically model the working environment and relay that information to the operator in virtual reality (VR).

274	DTCPS	An AI Driven Real-time 3-D Representation of an Off-shore WT for Fault Diagnosis and Monitoring	In recent years, digital twin (DT) has been an efficient and reliable representation tool for Industry 4.0 in general and fault diagnosis and monitoring, especially in machinery consisting of several components working in tandem that introduce a large amount of data to be processed. Having a cloud-based and platform-independent system that can interpret Big Data in real-time and represent the processed information in a user-friendly manner offers the opportunity not only for improving fault diagnosis and troubleshooting automation, but also offering a better representation of data for operators, technicians and engineers. This not only decreases the repair costs by enabling constant components' state of health awareness, but also increases the efficacy of the apparatus by lowering the downtimes due to faults and issues.In this paper (WindTwin), we propose a real-time, interactive and dynamic 3-D neural-network model that provides important information of a small-scale wind turbine (WT) machinery setup including the state of health of different components (bearings, shafts) based on monitoring sensors (vibrations and temperature) and operations conditions (rotation speed). The system features real-time data processing of six sensors with eight channels including two single axis-accelerometer, one tri-axial accelerometer, one acoustics (microphone), one temperature and one light sensor (for rotational speed) with sampling data collection rate of 51.2 kHz achieved through an edge developed machine learning algorithm based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm using single hidden-layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) and gradient-based backpropagation (BP) training algorithm. The system also provides platform-independent (desktop and mobile companion app) user interfaces thanks to its cloud-based data processing integration. The prototype system proved to have on average 83.33 \% accuracy for the vibration-based condition monitoring model across the three different rotation speed of 15Hz, 9Hz and 12Hz with 1 second latency for different fault conditions to be reflected on the DT counterpart.	artificial intelligence;  big data;  cloud-computing;  condition monitoring;  digital twin;  digitization;  machine learning; artificial intelligence, big data, cloud-computing, condition monitoring, digital twin, digitization, machine learning	Amini, Amin; Kanfound, Jamil; Gan, Tat-Hean	ICAAI '19: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Advances in Artificial Intelligence	https://doi.org/10.1145/3369114.3369141		162-165	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3369114.3369141,

275	DTCPS	Interoperable Digital Twins in IIoT Systems by Transformation of Information Models: A Case Study with Asset Administration Shell	By providing a consolidated access point to information of devices and systems, digital twins enable new, data-intensive use cases for the industrial internet of things (IIoT), like predictive plant and product design. However, the lack of interoperability between the digital twins of different companies hinders use cases that require information exchange between different organizations. Achieving interoperability among digital twins requires transforming the included information to other formats. In this paper, we present requirements and a solution to enable interoperable digital twins by transforming their information models in a flexible way. We illustrate how we applied our solution to a real-world application example in an industrial context by transforming ABB Ability(tm) digital twins to the Asset Administration Shell format.

In contrast to industrial robots, the development of service robots comes with severe software engineering challenges, since they require high levels of robustness and autonomy to operate in highly heterogeneous environments. As a domain with critical safety implications, service robotics faces a need for sound software development practices.

277	DTCPS	Model-driven digital twin construction: synthesizing the integration of cyber-physical systems with their information systems	Digital twins emerge in many disciplines to support engineering, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing cyber-physical systems, such as airplanes, cars, factories, medical devices, or ships. There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.	software architecture;  model-driven software engineering;  information systems;  digital twins;  cyber-physical systems; software architecture, model-driven software engineering, information systems, digital twins, cyber-physical systems	"Kirchhof, J\""{o}rg Christian; Michael, Judith; Rumpe, Bernhard; Varga, Simon; Wortmann, Andreas"	MODELS '20: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3365438.3410941		90-101	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3365438.3410941,

279	DTCPS	A scheme for anomalous RFID trajectory detection based on improved clustering algorithm under digital-twin-driven	Anomaly analysis of trajectories is one of the means to maintain indoor safety. Effective track anomaly detection should be based on the current road network structure. However, the indoor environment usually contains many obstacles flexible to move. The changes in the positions of obstacles frequently cause the changes of the road network structure. When the road network changes, it takes time and effort to manually redraw the road network and simultaneously losses the guarantee of real-time performance. At the same time, manual drawing is forbidden in some confidential places. In our paper, the scheme of RFID track anomaly detection combined with digital-twin technology is proposed to provide a real-time actual road network for anomaly analysis. The accurate mapping and virtual simulation functions of digital-twin technology are used to achieve the dynamic real-time rendering and the maintenance of the indoor road network structure. We also improve a clustering algorithm to make it suitable for indoor RFID track clustering. In our paper, deviation thresholds and digital-twin model are used to detect anomalies. The trajectory is judged to be abnormal when it appears in the restricted areas or exceeds the deviation thresholds in any terms of position, velocity, or direction. We use an improved scan-line algorithm and F1-scores to determine the threshold values. Our proposed anomaly detection method provides more effective and intuitive results for researchers to analyze.	digital-twin;  clustering;  anomaly detection;  RFID trajectory; digital-twin, clustering, anomaly detection, RFID trajectory	Cai, Mengnan; Wang, Siye; Shen, Xinling; Jin, Yijia	MobiQuitous '19: Proceedings of the 16th EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services	https://doi.org/10.1145/3360774.3360809		126-134	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3360774.3360809,

280	DTCPS	Entangled Ethnography: Towards a collective future understanding	In this work, we develop a vision for entangled ethnography, where constellations of people, artefacts, algorithms and data come together to collectively make sense of the relations between people and objects. This is grounded in New Materialism's picture of a world understood through entanglement, through resonant constellations, through a multiplicity of unique individual viewpoints and their relationships. These perspectives are especially relevant for design ethnography, in particular for research around smart connected products, which collect data about their environment, the networks they are a part of, and the ways they are used. However, we are concerned about the current trend of many connected systems towards surveillance capitalism, as data is colonised, machinations are hidden, and a narrow definition of value is extracted. There is a key tension that while design, particularly of networked objects, attempts to go beyond human centeredness, the infrastructures that support it are moving towards a less than human perspective in their race to accumulate and dispossess.

    abstract = ""In this work, we develop a vision for entangled ethnography, where constellations of people, artefacts, algorithms and data come together to collectively make sense of the relations between people and objects. This is grounded in New Materialism's picture of a world understood through entanglement, through resonant constellations, through a multiplicity of unique individual viewpoints and their relationships. These perspectives are especially relevant for design ethnography, in particular for research around smart connected products, which collect data about their environment, the networks they are a part of, and the ways they are used. However, we are concerned about the current trend of many connected systems towards surveillance capitalism, as data is colonised, machinations are hidden, and a narrow definition of value is extracted. There is a key tension that while design, particularly of networked objects, attempts to go beyond human centeredness, the infrastructures that support it are moving towards a less than human perspective in their race to accumulate and dispossess. Our work tries to imagine the situations where participants in networked systems are richly engaged, rather than exploited. We hope for a future where human agency is central to a respectful and acceptable collaborative development of understanding."",

283	DTCPS	Exploiting Social Media to enhance Clinical Decision Support	Social media are increasingly used to collect data and report on the personal health status, on health issues, symptoms and experiences with treatments. The health data that is, thus, becoming available represents a valuable source for continuous health monitoring and prevention, and clinical decision making. Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them accurately. Social media data can be used to understand, in near real time, human life dynamics worldwide. These massive quantities of data could support in a wide range of medical and healthcare applications, including among others clinical trials and decision support. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) can greatly help in identifying diseases and methods of treatment. In this paper we propose a CDS framework that can integrate heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as laboratory test results, basic information of patients, health records and social media data. Using the electronic health medical data so collected, innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches are employed to implement a set of services to recommend a list of diseases and thus assist physicians in diagnosing or treating their patients' health issues more efficiently.

284	DTCPS	Toward a Graphical Modeling Tool for Response-Time Requirements Based on Soft and Hard Real-Time Capabilities in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems	Emerging industrial digitization metaphors such as cyber-physical systems and digital twins increasingly advocate the use of distributed and autonomous modular solutions. This article proposes a visual notation for modeling the timing properties of such modular industrial systems. The proposed work builds upon an existing notation that enables the analysis of the timing properties and requirements of potentially competing automation solutions. It provides a set of symbols that capture, among others, communication networks and devices, I/O interfaces, and industrial controllers. This article extends this preexisting notation by modeling the relation between physical devices and their controlling software in the context of industrial automation applications. The existing notation and its extensions are described and applied to a miniaturized automation system to illustrate its dual usage: as a tool to collect requirements and as a tool to analyze existing systems. The testing scenario highlights the opportunities provided by the extensions in comparison to the preexisting notation, which, for the sake of completeness, is more briefly introduced and described.

In addition, the digital twin is an important measure to achieve intelligent manufacturing and industry 4.0. The advancement of DT system in manufacturing environment is evident. However, current researches in manufacturing domain concentrated on the discussion of architecture optimization of digital twin system combining with existing cyber-physics researches. There are little research works reported practical DT system and discussed the technologies in implementation. Different from current works, this paper proposed an advanced Digital Twin system for CNC machine tool and discussed the critical enablers to make the DT system more practicality.First, data stream from CAD/CAM to CNC is improved with the STEP-NC standard which containing more structured process data to enhance the information in virtual environment to reflect the real machining process. Second, hardware connection method with CNC system is summarized and a uniform interface for data accessing is proposed to simplify the development of DT system. At last, a virtual machining environment (software named ""GrapeSim"") is presented which contains three functions: estimating the machining state according to the accessed data from CNC; material removing simulation that synchronous with the real machining process to illustrate the geometry shape of machined workpiece; a web server that allowing other devices to obtain the data in virtual environment as a data source of cloud manufacturing.The whole Digital Twin system is tested in COMAC, the manufacturer of ARJ21 and C919 jetliner, and all functions are proved stable and useful."

As Digital Twin they form a virtual representation of the physical objects with their different views and characteristics. The contents spread over various disciplines, stakeholders and life cycle phases; they form a huge space of linked data and resources.Visualizing this information space is challenging, especially as it is closely related to the physical process and the manufacturing environment. Interaction technologies such as Mixed Reality (MR) offer an alternative to the traditional screen-based systems, that are still common in automation technology. The presented demo shows a spatial interface for the MR glasses HoloLens to explore various data resources in the context of a manufacturing cell. The user can view and interact with the content (such as media, documents, live data, functionalities) as a spatial graph. He can see the real and the digital resources at the same time, interact with those objects and control the machine as well.

A key challenge for designers is to gather useful insights from this data in order to accelerate product research, which can be time consuming and labour intensive. Through the Chatty Products dashboard we aim to explore how virtual representations of IoT products and their sensor data, also known as digital twins, can support insight gathering. This demo will present a series of Bluetooth IoT speakers, which are connected to the Chatty Products dashboard, a data exploration and visualisation research tool containing supervisory digital twins of the speakers. The project aims to visualise live data as it relates to the physical product in the wild, enabling contextual inquiry and supporting data exploration. The demo will promote a dialogue around how digital twins can be used to gather design insights based on live data.	live data;  digital twins;  design research;  contextual inquiry;  IoT products; live data, digital twins, design research, contextual inquiry, IoT products	Burnett, Dan; Thorp, James; Richards, Daniel; Gorkovenko, Katerina; Murray-Rust, Dave	PerDis '19: Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Symposium on Pervasive Displays	https://doi.org/10.1145/3321335.3329685		1-2	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3321335.3329685,

One operator may be responsible for several machines that need to run continuously. Unfortunately, the complexity of the machines and processes increased faster than the improvement in the corresponding interaction technologies. We propose a multi-modal adaptive human computer interface system for the modern industry that relies on position, activity and other relevant contextual information, in order to provide a more flexible interaction in industrial scenarios. Information about the machine, is transmitted to the worker using a vibrotactile display on his wrist whenever the line of sight is broken. The context in which the user and the machine currently reside in, are determined by software artefacts (Apps). We leverage modern software concepts and an App based eco-system platform on the manufacturing shop floor to organize the software systems described in this paper. We evaluate transmitting arbitrary information via vibrotactile displays and come to the conclusion that such a system is feasible in industrial settings and may be beneficial as it has a very low distraction rate.	hybrid software architectures;  haptic interfaces;  directional cues;  deployment and usage;  dashboards;  control room; hybrid software architectures, haptic interfaces, directional cues, deployment and usage, dashboards, control room	"Miclaus, Andrei; Pescara, Erik; M\""{a}dche, Alexander; Beigl, Michael"	PETRA '19: Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments	https://doi.org/10.1145/3316782.3322751		382-388	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3316782.3322751,

301	DTCPS	A Hierarchical Digital Twin Model Framework for Dynamic Cyber-Physical System Design	Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a new trend in the complex system related research works, where network connectivity enhances computing power and systemic behavior emerges through the competition, interaction, collaboration and integration among individual interweaving, which consists of real-time monitoring, data management, physical feedback control. From this perspective, CPS is a dynamic entity with rich functions. However, designers may encounter a difficult situation, in which subsequent dynamic changes of the system are discussed and appropriate functionalities are added in the early design phase. Since the digital twin is the digital duplicate of the physical entity, it can dynamically evolve following the product life cycle. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical digital twin model framework for CPS design. In the light of digital twin concept, the hierarchical high-level models facilitate storage of information from the entire product life cycle. Finally, an industrial robot application is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the model framework.

304	DTCPS	A quality of experience evaluation system and research challenges for networked virtual reality-based teleoperation applications	Teleoperation applications are designed to assist humans in operating complex mechanical systems. Interfaces to teleoperation systems have always been challenging. Recently the potential of virtual reality (VR) has been a topic of interest, particularly with the availability of head mounted displays and interaction controller devices. As a result, research into the viability of VR as a technology to support remote operation and improved human machine interaction has emerged. It is assumed that VR will offer the user a more immersive and natural experience when operating a virtual representation of a mechanical system. To achieve this, there are a number of research challenges that need to be addressed. In this short paper, we introduce and discuss key challenges for VR-based teleoperation systems. Since the key focus of our work is understand user quality of experience (QoE) of VR-based teleoperation applications, the design and implementation of an implicit and explicit QoE Evaluation system is also presented.	virtual reality;  remote operation;  quality of experience;  physiological metrics;  networks;  network delay;  cyber physical systems; virtual reality, remote operation, quality of experience, physiological metrics, networks, network delay, cyber physical systems	Concannon, David; Flynn, Ronan; Murray, Niall	MMVE '19: Proceedings of the 11th ACM Workshop on Immersive Mixed and Virtual Environment Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3304113.3326119		10-12	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3304113.3326119,

305	DTCPS	QUILT: quality inference from living digital twins in IoT-enabled manufacturing systems	A Digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09\% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors.	smart manufacturing;  machine learning;  internet-of-things;  digital twin; smart manufacturing, machine learning, internet-of-things, digital twin	Chhetri, Sujit Rokka; Faezi, Sina; Canedo, Arquimedes; Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah Al	IoTDI '19: Proceedings of the International Conference on Internet of Things Design and Implementation	https://doi.org/10.1145/3302505.3310085		237-248	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3302505.3310085,

They are also useful to compose flexible and reusable workflows in cyber-physical systems (CPS) involving hardware devices, software applications, smart objects and humans. In this work, we discuss the concepts of Cyber-physical Consistency and Cyber-physical Synchronization for workflows in CPS. Consistency enables verification of the workflow execution by comparing the assumed virtual world outcome with the actual effects in the physical world. Synchronization is used for restoring a consistent state in case of deviations realized by the MAPE-K control loop for self-adaptive systems.

308	DTCPS	The internet of things in undergraduate computer and information science education: exploring curricula and pedagogy	As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues its expansion into homes, businesses, government, and industries, the impact for computer science educators is amplified. In 2017, the ITiCSE IoT working group identified relevant content, tools for teaching, and four IoT course types. The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT? We found very little scholarship describing actual teaching practices, but our interviewees described their approaches and challenges in teaching.

The IIoT forms the backbone for materializing the Industry 4.0 initiative. Actionable insights obtained from industrial analytics are one of the pivotal means for achieving intelligent operations and maintenance. Intelligence refers to making optimal decisions for both automated and human-in-the-loop decision making. Condition-based predictive maintenance (CBPdM), also known as Maintenance 4.0, is among the major focus points of the Industry 4.0 and IIoT. In this paper, we discuss the existing standards related to condition-based maintenance and the potential of the Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE), a MIMOSA led initiative, as a framework which extends previous open standards for achieving CBPdM. We illustrate how the framework addresses the requirements of Industry 4.0 and CBPdM.

315	DTCPS	A Cloud-based Control System Architecture for Multi-UAV	Unmanned aerial vehicle is considered one of the most promising technologies. Controlling UAV over the cloud is an emerging research area motivated by the emergence of Cloud Robotics and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). This paper presents a control system architecture based on cloud platform which has been developed in order to allow multiple users to control and monitor multiple UAVs simultaneously irrespective of the location. Furthermore, the system allows to build and allocate missions to UAV and analyze the execution data that collect by sensors. The architecture of the system is fully based on open source software and protocols. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the system architecture, we implemented and validated it using SITL (software in the loop) simulator. Experimental results show that the system is efficient in monitoring and controlling UAV remotely through the Internet.

319	DTCPS	Early Take-Over Preparation in Stereoscopic 3D	Situation awareness in highly automated vehicles can help the driver to get back in the loop during a take-over request (TOR). We propose to present the driver a detailed digital representation of situations causing a TOR via a scaled down digital twin of the highway inside the car. The digital twin virtualizes real time traffic information and is displayed before the actual TOR. In the car cockpit an augmented reality headset or a Stereoscopic 3D (S3D) interface can realize the augmentation. As today's hardware has technical limitations, we build an HMD based mock-up. We conducted a user study (N=20) to assess the driver behavior during a TOR. We found that workload decreases and steering performance raise significantly with the proposed system. We argue that the augmentation of the surrounding world in the car helps to improve performance during TOR due to better awareness of the upcoming situation.

321	DTCPS	Understanding the Modeling of Computer Network Delays using Neural Networks	Recent trends in networking are proposing the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the control and operation of the network. In this context, ML can be used as a computer network modeling technique to build models that estimate the network performance. Indeed, network modeling is a central technique to many networking functions, for instance in the field of optimization, in which the model is used to search a configuration that satisfies the target policy. In this paper, we aim to provide an answer to the following question: Can neural networks accurately model the delay of a computer network as a function of the input traffic? For this, we assume the network as a black-box that has as input a traffic matrix and as output delays. Then we train different neural networks models and evaluate its accuracy under different fundamental network characteristics: topology, size, traffic intensity and routing. With this, we aim to have a better understanding of computer network modeling with neural nets and ultimately provide practical guidelines on how such models need to be trained.

322	DTCPS	Self-Generation of Access Control Policies	Access control for information has primarily focused on access statically granted to subjects by administrators usually in the context of a specific system. Even if mechanisms are available for access revocation, revocations must still be executed manually by an administrator. However, as physical devices become increasingly embedded and interconnected, access control needs to become an integral part of the resource being protected and be generated dynamically by resources depending on the context in which the resource is being used. In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed. We discuss some approaches for generating such access control policies that may address the requirements of the scenarios.

323	DTCPS	Sensorclone: a framework for harnessing smart devices with virtual sensors	IoT services hosted by low-power devices rely on the cloud infrastructure to propagate their ubiquitous presence over the Internet. A critical challenge for IoT systems is to ensure continuous provisioning of IoT services by overcoming network breakdowns, hardware failures, and energy constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose a cloud-based framework namely SensorClone, which relies on virtual devices to improve IoT resilience. A virtual device is the digital counterpart of a physical device that has learned to emulate its operations from sample data collected from the physical one. SensorClone exploits the collected data of low-power devices to create virtual devices in the cloud. SensorClone then can opportunistically migrate virtual devices from the cloud into other devices, potentially underutilized, with higher capabilities and closer to the edge of the network, e.g., smart devices. Through a real deployment of our SensorClone in the wild, we identify that virtual devices can be used for two purposes, 1) to reduce the energy consumption of physical devices by duty cycling their service provisioning between the physical device and the virtual representation hosted in the cloud, and 2) to scale IoT services at the edge of the network by harnessing temporal periods of underutilization of smart devices. To evaluate our framework, we present a use case of a virtual sensor created from an IoT service of temperature. From our results, we verify that it is possible to achieve unlimited availability up to 90\% and substantial power efficiency under acceptable levels of quality of service. Our work makes contributions towards improving IoT scalability and resilience by using virtual devices.	cloud computing;  edge computing;  internet of things;  opportunistic migration;  resilience;  virtual sensor; cloud computing, edge computing, internet of things, opportunistic migration, resilience, virtual sensor	Flores, Huber; Hui, Pan; Tarkoma, Sasu; Li, Yong; Anagnostopoulos, Theodoros; Kostakos, Vassilis; Luo, Chu; Su, Xiang	MMSys '18: Proceedings of the 9th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference	https://doi.org/10.1145/3204949.3204952		328-338	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3204949.3204952,

    abstract = ""IoT services hosted by low-power devices rely on the cloud infrastructure to propagate their ubiquitous presence over the Internet. A critical challenge for IoT systems is to ensure continuous provisioning of IoT services by overcoming network breakdowns, hardware failures, and energy constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose a cloud-based framework namely SensorClone, which relies on virtual devices to improve IoT resilience. A virtual device is the digital counterpart of a physical device that has learned to emulate its operations from sample data collected from the physical one. SensorClone exploits the collected data of low-power devices to create virtual devices in the cloud. SensorClone then can opportunistically migrate virtual devices from the cloud into other devices, potentially underutilized, with higher capabilities and closer to the edge of the network, e.g., smart devices. Through a real deployment of our SensorClone in the wild, we identify that virtual devices can be used for two purposes, 1) to reduce the energy consumption of physical devices by duty cycling their service provisioning between the physical device and the virtual representation hosted in the cloud, and 2) to scale IoT services at the edge of the network by harnessing temporal periods of underutilization of smart devices. To evaluate our framework, we present a use case of a virtual sensor created from an IoT service of temperature. From our results, we verify that it is possible to achieve unlimited availability up to 90\\% and substantial power efficiency under acceptable levels of quality of service. Our work makes contributions towards improving IoT scalability and resilience by using virtual devices."",

324	DTCPS	Towards Security-Aware Virtual Environments for Digital Twins	Digital twins open up new possibilities in terms of monitoring, simulating, optimizing and predicting the state of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Furthermore, we argue that a fully functional, virtual replica of a CPS can also play an important role in securing the system. In this work, we present a framework that allows users to create and execute digital twins, closely matching their physical counterparts. We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.	simulation;  security monitoring;  industrial control systems;  digital twin;  cyber-physical systems;  automationml; simulation, security monitoring, industrial control systems, digital twin, cyber-physical systems, automationml	Eckhart, Matthias; Ekelhart, Andreas	CPSS '18: Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical System Security	https://doi.org/10.1145/3198458.3198464		61-72	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3198458.3198464,

325	DTCPS	A Digital Twin Based Estimation Method for Health Indicators of DC-DC Converters	This article proposes a health indicator estimation method based on the digital-twin concept aiming for condition monitoring of power electronic converters. The method is noninvasive, without additional hardware circuits, and calibration requirements. An application for a buck dc-dc converter is demonstrated with theoretical analyses, practical considerations, and experimental verifications. The digital replica of an experimental prototype is established, which includes the power stage, sampling circuit, and close-loop controller. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to estimate the unknown circuit parameters of interest based on the incoming data from both the digital twin and the physical prototype. Cluster-data of the estimated health indicators under different testing conditions of the buck converter is analyzed and used for observing the degradation trends of key components, such as capacitor and MOSFET. The outcomes of this article serve as a key step for achieving noninvasive, cost-effective, and robust condition monitoring for power electronic converters.

326	DTCPS	INSpIRA: iNtegrating security into risk assessment: doctoral project paper	Today's software and hardware technologies enable the expansion of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) into the realms of mobility (car2x, autonomous driving), energy (power plants, smart grid) and healthcare (health monitoring), paving the way into a highly interlaced world. However, this also dramatically broadens the threat landscape for potential attacks on CPSs. The malfunction of these CPSs could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss [5, 9, 16]. This drives the need for comprehensive methods that support the cross-domain design, development and implementation of safe and secure systems [3, 4]. In order to tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a method called INSpIRA, a method for INtegrating Security Into Risk Assessment, including a toolchain implementing the method. The envisioned method is supposed to be a holistic approach that supports the efficient cross-domain design, development, implementation and maintenance of dependable CPSs, where security and safety are a critical aspect that requires an in-depth risk assessment.

328	DTCPS	A comparison between discrete analysis and a multiphase approach for predicting heat conduction in packed beds	The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a Lagrangian approach initially developed for predicting particles flow. The eXtended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) framework, developed at the LuXDEM Research Centre of the University of Luxembourg, extends DEM by including the thermochemical state of particles, as well as their interaction with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) domain. The level of detail of its predictions makes the XDEM suite a powerful tool for predicting complex industrial processes like steel making, powder metallurgy and additive manufacturing. Like in any other DEM software, the critical aspect of the simulations is the computation requirement that grows rapidly as the number of particles increases. Indeed, such burden currently represents the main bottleneck to its full exploitation in large-scale scenarios. Digital Twin, a research project founded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), aims at drastically accelerate XDEM through different approaches and make it an effective tool for numerical predictions in industry as well as virtual prototyping. The Multiphase Particle-In-Cell (MP-PIC) method has been introduced for reducing the computation burden of DEM. It has been initially developed for predicting particles flow and uses a two-way transfer of information between the Lagrangian entities and a computation grid. The method avoids explicit contact detection and can potentially achieve a drastic reduction of the time-to-solution respect to DEM. The present contribution introduces a multiphase approach for predicting the conductive heat transfer within a static packed bed of particles. Results from a test case are qualitatively and quantitatively compared against reference XDEM predictions. The method can be effectively exploited in combination with MP-PIC for predicting the thermochemical state of particles.

332	DTCPS	A Blockchain-Based Approach for the Creation of Digital Twins	The rapid advancements in computing, storage, communications, and networking technologies have enabled the creation of Digital Twins (DTs). A DT is a digital representation of a real-world physical component, product, or equipment. A DT can be used for 3-D design, testing, simulation, and prototyping prior to the manufacturing of the physical component. Once a physical component is in operation, a DT can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. It is expected that DTs will gain significant attention in the foreseeable future, and will play a key role in Industry 4.0. However, today's approaches, systems, and technologies leveraged for the creation of DTs are mostly centralized and fall short of providing trusted data provenance, audit, and traceability. Also, data related to transactions, logs, and history are not secure or tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based creation process of DTs to guarantee secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, logs, and data provenance. Our proposed approach uses smart contracts to govern and track transactions initiated by participants involved in the creation of DTs. Our approach also employs decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems to store and share DTs data. Moreover, we present details on our system design and architecture, implementation, and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide security and cost analysis, and show how our approach fulfills the requirements of DTs process creation. We make the smart contract code for creating DTs publicly available on Github.

333	DTCPS	Transparent Digital Twin for Output Control Using Belief Rule Base	A transparent digital twin (DT) is designed for output control using the belief rule base (BRB), namely, DT-BRB. The goal of the transparent DT-BRB is not only to model the complex relationships between the system inputs and output but also to conduct output control by identifying and optimizing the key parameters in the model inputs. The proposed DT-BRB approach is composed of three major steps. First, BRB is adopted to model the relationships between the inputs and output of the physical system. Second, an analytical procedure is proposed to identify only the key parameters in the system inputs with the highest contribution to the output. Being consistent with the inferencing, integration, and unification procedures of BRB, there are also three parts in the contribution calculation in this step. Finally, the data-driven optimization is performed to control the system output. A practical case study on the Wuhan Metro System is conducted for reducing the building tilt rate (BTR) in tunnel construction. By comparing the results following different standards, the 80% contribution standard is proved to have the highest marginal contribution that identifies only 43.5% parameters as the key parameters but can reduce the BTR by 73.73%. Moreover, it is also observed that the proposed DT-BRB approach is so effective that iterative optimizations are not necessarily needed.

334	DTCPS	Toward physics-based virtual reality testbeds for intelligent robot manipulators - an eRobotics approach	The increasingly pervasive usage of robotic automation not only calls for a high performance of physical robot manipulators, but also implies challenging requirements on 3D robot simulators. A skillful reaction of simulated robots to unpredicted contact forces has become an especially stringent necessity to support the development of emerging applications for which a compliant robotic manipulation is indispensable. This paper focuses on the simulation of physics-based virtual testbeds in which simulated robots are made capable of accommodating external forces exerted by the environment on their manipulators. For this, we integrate methods from multi-body dynamics modeling, advanced robotics, and virtual reality to develop a robotics simulation basis that facilitates the employment of compliant robotic manipulations in simulated applications. The validation of this basis in joint space indicates that a physics-based simulation of robots endowed with active physical interaction control can capture and reflect significant effects which characterize the interactive behavior of physical compliant robots.We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach to unlock competitive advantages in fully simulated applications prone to position uncertainty. Furthermore, we show the potential of using compliant digital twins of physical robots to introduce compliant robotic manipulations into real applications.

335	DTCPS	The application of virtual reality in programming of a manufacturing cell	Programming of industrial robots and manufacturing equipment in general requires product specific expertise towards all members in a manufacturing cell. Typically, old and new equipment is present in the same setup and several experts are often involved in the operation of these systems. In order to decrease the level of complexity in programming of manufacturing equipment this paper investigates the use of virtual reality (VR), to create a common programming platform for typical members in a manufacturing setup. A two-way digital twin is created where all robots can be programmed through the same human-machine-interface (HMI). This cyber-physical system (CPS) allows for simulations, testing and safety checks before all programs are converted and downloaded to the respective units.

336	DTCPS	A Digital Twin-Based Approach for Quality Control and Optimization of Complex Product Assembly	To address the problems caused by low ability of quality analysis and decision-making in the process of complex product assembly, in this paper, we proposed a digital twin-based approach for quality control and optimization of complex product assembly, by providing a digital twin system to realize the timely and precisely interactive mapping between the physical world and digital world. Specifically, a quality control and optimization mechanism is presented, which provides the theoretical support to the realization of the digital twin-based approach. A data-driven quality control model is introduced to solve the optimization problem by considering the panoramic assembly quality data. A digital twin system for complex product assembly is elaborated by providing detailed deployment and implementation procedures, which includes (1) building of the digital entity of an assembly line, (2) real-time online sensing in multi-source heterogeneous environment, (3) real-time simulation of equipment and assembly process, (4) realization of the intelligent production scheduling under uncertainty conditions, and (5) dynamical adjustment of the assembly process. Finally, the paper presents the validation results considering the practical applications of the proposed approach in real industrial fields.

339	DTCPS	A Blockchain-Based Crypto-Anchor Platform for Interoperable Product Authentication	Counterfeiting is a major problem in many industries, causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damages every year. Digital twins further increase a product's value, making it critical to secure the link between the physical and digital world. An entire industry has sprung up to address this problem with a wide variety of product-authentication technologies, or crypto anchors, offering many different trade-offs between supported product surface, security level, price sensitivity, ease of use, etc. Each crypto-anchor vendor provides their own APIs for commissioning, verification and monitoring which makes it hard for application developers to support many of them. This paper introduces a platform that provides a generic model of an object secured by a crypto anchor, supporting any number of product authentication technologies by means of crypto-anchor plugins. Applications programmed against this generic model can immediately interoperate with any of the plugged-in crypto anchors. We present a blockchain architecture for the platform whose decentralization matches the highly differentiated industry structure. We've implemented the system on Hyperledger Fabric.

340	DTCPS	A Digital Twin Platform for Multi-Rotor UAV	A digital twin platform framework for multi-rotor UAV is proposed in this paper. The platform is composed of simulation system, physical UAV and service center, which is designed to solve the problem about UAV advanced capability training and algorithm verification. As we know, a good UAV system verification method is to make full use of virtual simulation before repeated physical tests. However, there is a gap between the virtual simulation and physical test results, because the simulation model is difficult to completely describe the actual physical object. So the hidden risks may exist in actual physical tests by only using the results of virtual simulations. Based on the feedback control idea, the actual state data of the physical UAV is fed back to virtual simulation platform, and the virtual simulation platform completes virtual and real joint training and verification based on this. That is, the technology of digital twin is introduced into the UAV system development process in this paper. In addition, the digital twin platform structure of two-way interaction between virtual space, physical space and service center is proposed. The 4G/5G communication interface is developed to improve the platform's real-time interaction capabilities.

    abstract = ""A digital twin platform framework for multi-rotor UAV is proposed in this paper. The platform is composed of simulation system, physical UAV and service center, which is designed to solve the problem about UAV advanced capability training and algorithm verification. As we know, a good UAV system verification method is to make full use of virtual simulation before repeated physical tests. However, there is a gap between the virtual simulation and physical test results, because the simulation model is difficult to completely describe the actual physical object. So the hidden risks may exist in actual physical tests by only using the results of virtual simulations. Based on the feedback control idea, the actual state data of the physical UAV is fed back to virtual simulation platform, and the virtual simulation platform completes virtual and real joint training and verification based on this. That is, the technology of digital twin is introduced into the UAV system development process in this paper. In addition, the digital twin platform structure of two-way interaction between virtual space, physical space and service center is proposed. The 4G/5G communication interface is developed to improve the platform's real-time interaction capabilities. Besides, the components of the platform and the construction process are introduced in detail. Finally, three platform test experiments are used to verify the interactive characteristics of the platform and introduce the operating process of the platform."",

341	DTCPS	Virtual Reality for Remote Controlled Robotics in Engineering Education	There is a high demand for high-end lab equipment in engineering education, especially for courses that require practical hands-on lab exercises. However, this equipment is quite expensive which forces some institutions to seek other alternatives or forego them altogether. In addition, online courses tend to be light on hardware because of the practical and technical challenges associated with running remote hardware-based laboratories. Therefore, a system is needed that allows students who are enrolled in remote courses to experience hardware-intensive classes just as they would an in-person course (especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this work, use virtual and augmented reality to build and test a remote UR-10 robotics lab that allows students to work together on a hands-on robotics-based lab. In the future, we plan to demonstrate its technical and pedagogical suitability by running a user study in a real-world class whereby remote students enrolled in a course will participate in a series of experiments to control a UR-10 robot arm. It opens up avenues to explore the advantages and shortcomings of running coordinated group lab exercises between students from different institutions, time-zones, and continents by time-decoupling the schedules. The use of a Virtual Reality interface coupled with a digital twin of the UR10 robot will allow us to investigate the suitability of different user interfaces, and what VR tools would best facilitate remote group work and faculty instruction.

Contracts are used to model the different parts composing the line; the modeling is guided by a well-known taxonomy associating industrial machines to manufacturing processes and their elementary actions, each represented by a contract. The composition of contracts representing the actions of a machine specifies each possible manufacturing process implemented by the machine. Then, automatic synthesis from contracts is used to generate an executable model of the machines composing the plant. The generated models are finally integrated into a state-of-the-practice industrial plant simulation software to validate the execution of the production line.The entire methodology is presented by showing its step-by-step application to a concrete scenario.

347	DTCPS	Scalable Sensor Models and Simulation Methods for Seamless Transitions Within System Development: From First Digital Prototype to Final Real System	Highly automated systems are taking over an increasing number of human tasks. This includes not only the execution of certain actions but also perception and interpretation of the environment. Here, environment-perceiving sensor systems such as camera, lidar, or radar represent a key technology while posing a major challenge in terms of complex physical interactions that make validation very complicated. Typically, required system tests within dynamic environments are enabled too late, while real-world testing is neither efficient nor sufficient. Striving for a seamless transition from a first digital prototype to the final real system, we propose the use of digital twins and hybrid testbeds. These combine real and simulated components per availability or requirement to continuously enable simulation-based validation in all stages of development. To this end, we present an overall concept of scalable sensor models and simulation methods that meet the varying requirements along the development process by introducing a triple-axis scalability. Here, reusable building blocks allow for scaling across different sensor types and applications with varying level of detail, while natural interfaces and measurement-accurate ground truth annotators ensure a seamless integration into the underlying development process using methods of X-in-the-loop.

    abstract = ""Highly automated systems are taking over an increasing number of human tasks. This includes not only the execution of certain actions but also perception and interpretation of the environment. Here, environment-perceiving sensor systems such as camera, lidar, or radar represent a key technology while posing a major challenge in terms of complex physical interactions that make validation very complicated. Typically, required system tests within dynamic environments are enabled too late, while real-world testing is neither efficient nor sufficient. Striving for a seamless transition from a first digital prototype to the final real system, we propose the use of digital twins and hybrid testbeds. These combine real and simulated components per availability or requirement to continuously enable simulation-based validation in all stages of development. To this end, we present an overall concept of scalable sensor models and simulation methods that meet the varying requirements along the development process by introducing a triple-axis scalability. Here, reusable building blocks allow for scaling across different sensor types and applications with varying level of detail, while natural interfaces and measurement-accurate ground truth annotators ensure a seamless integration into the underlying development process using methods of X-in-the-loop."",

349	DTCPS	Sustainability Assessment of Intelligent Manufacturing Supported by Digital Twin	As a major challenge and opportunity for traditional manufacturing, intelligent manufacturing is facing the needs of sustainable development in future. Sustainability assessment undoubtedly plays a pivotal role for future development of intelligent manufacturing. Aiming at this, the paper presents the digital twin driven information architecture of sustainability assessment oriented for dynamic evolution under the whole life cycle based on the classic digital twin mapping system. The sustainability assessment method segment of the architecture includes indicator system building, indicator value determination, indicator importance degree determination and intelligent manufacturing project assessing. A novel approach for treating the ambiguity of expert' judgment in indicator value determination by introducing trapezoidal fuzzy number into analytic hierarchy process is proposed, while the complexity of the influence relationship among the indicators is processed by the integration of complex networks modeling and PROMETHEE II for the indicator importance degree determination. A two-stage evidence combination model based on evidence theory is built for intelligent manufacturing project assessing lastly. The presented digital-twin-driven information architecture and the sustainability assessment method is tested and validated on a study of sustainability assessment of 8 intelligent manufacturing projects of an air conditioning enterprise. The results of the presented method were validated by comparing them with the results of the fuzzy and rough extension of the PROMETHEE II, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods, indicator importance degree determining method by entropy and indicator value determining method by accurate expert scoring.

350	DTCPS	Towards Automated Structural Health Monitoring for Offshore Wind Piles	Simulation plays an important role in the development, testing and evaluation of new robotic applications, reducing implementation time, cost and risk. In this paper we show a digital twin simulation model of an inspection ROV which is capable of performing structural health monitoring by automated creation of a map of an offshore wind monopile. The data is compared to a known reference model. The digital twin simulation model is extended by a physical sensor data input device to bridge the gap between simulation and testing in water.

352	DTCPS	Scalable and Physical Radar Sensor Simulation for Interacting Digital Twins	Automation, artificial intelligence and sensor-enabled applications are part of everyday life comprising technical systems that utilize environment-perceiving sensors. Here, rough environments often require robust sensor technologies such as radar, coupled with application-specific software evaluating the measured data. The rising complexity of underlying sensor systems (hard- and software) and complex physical interactions with dynamic environments require development-related validations that use virtual methods primarily focusing on close-to-reality sensor simulation. To allow for a wide range of applications, we propose the use of reusable building blocks that generically model and mimic the physical structure from the real world. This includes the whole path between sensor and 3D environment with respect to sensor-intrinsic characteristics as well as environmental influences such as rain. At the same time, computational scalability of each building block allows physical simulations generating reliable sensor data even in real-time applications. As a result, Digital Twins of relevant components, systems and environments are no longer acting on their own but interacting within Virtual Testbeds allowing for virtual validation of radar-based applications with respect to the operational environment.

353	DTCPS	Model-Based Systems Engineering Tool-Chain for Automated Parameter Value Selection	Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate heterogeneous systems and process sensor data using digital services. As the complexity of CPS increases, it becomes more challenging to efficiently formalize the integrated multidomain views with flexible automated verification across the entire lifecycle. This article illustrates a model-based systems engineering tool-chain to support CPS development with an emphasis on automated parameter value selection for co-simulation. First, a domain-specific modeling approach is introduced to support the formalizations of CPS artifacts, development processes, and simulation configurations. The domain-specific models are used as the basis to generate a Web-based process management system for automated parameter value selections, which coordinates Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration services of development information and technical resources (models, data, and tools) in order to support automated co-simulation. The services are deployed by a service orchestrator based on a decision-making algorithm for parameter value selection. Finally, developers make use of the WPMS to implement simulations and to select system parameter values for co-simulation automatically. The approach is illustrated by a case study on auto-braking system development and we evaluate the efficiency of this tool-chain by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that parameter values are selected more efficiently and effectively when implementing co-simulations using our tool-chain.

354	DTCPS	On the Implementation of IoT-Based Digital Twin for Networked Microgrids Resiliency Against Cyber Attacks	The increased rate of cyber-attacks on the power system necessitates the need for innovative solutions to ensure its resiliency. This work builds on the advancement in the IoT to provide a practical framework that is able to respond to multiple attacks on a network of interconnected microgrids. This paper provides an IoT-based digital twin (DT) of the cyber-physical system that interacts with the control system to ensure its proper operation.

355	DTCPS	Symbiotic System of Systems Design for Safe and Resilient Autonomous Robotics in Offshore Wind Farms	To reduce Operation and Maintenance (O&M) expenditure on offshore wind farms, wherein 80% of the cost relates to deploying personnel, the offshore wind sector looks to advances in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) for solutions. Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot. This evaluation demonstrates that the SSOSA provides enhanced run-time operational resilience and safety compliance to BVLOS autonomous missions. The SSOSA has the potential to be a highly transferable methodology to other mission scenarios and technologies, providing a pathway to implementing scalable autonomy as a service.

357	DTCPS	The Life Cycle State Evaluation of Electrical Equipment based on Digital Twins	"Nowadays, with the development of smart technologies, more requirements for the state evaluation of electrical equipment have been raised during the full life cycle. In order to meet these demands, the digital twin is a very suitable technology. The digital twins could understand the state of the physical entities through physical models, sensing data and the big data generated from the product lifecycle, so as to predict, estimate, and analyze the dynamic changes. The digital twin is mainly composed of the information data, data exchange interface and digital model. The information data is obtained from the equipment production, operation and management process, including equipment production information and CAD model, environmental information, pre-test and maintenance data, online monitoring data and various sensor measurement data. It provides a comprehensive description of the actual equipment. The data exchange interface is a standardized information transmission channel, which ensures timely and efficient data transmission at various time periods throughout the life cycle of the equipment. The digital model acquires the date through the date exchange interface, structurally stores the data, establishes a virtual model corresponding to the equipment. In order to build up the digital twin, two main problems should be solved. One is the acquisition and storage of the data, the other is the responding speed of the digital model. In the current equipment management system, the various information data of the equipment entire life cycle are independent of each other, and the data utilization efficiency is quite low. Thus, we put forward the life cycle digital thread for the electrical equipment. It contains not only the data of design, production, installation and operation, but also the virials sensing data, environment date and historical experience data of similar equipment. To solve the problem of the responding speed, the preparatory simulation model has been put forward. In this model, a series of the equipment statues are simulated forward and the results are stored in the digital twin. Based on these simulation results and the simplified physical model, the relationship of the sensing data and the equipment state is build. Then, the relationship is revised and optimized through experiment to make sure of the accuracy of the model. This paper studies the data modelling methods and applies the ""digital twin"" to the electrical equipment. It is of great significance for the development of intelligent electrical equipment."

360	DTCPS	Real-time Smart Microgrid Simulation: The integration of communication layer in electrical simulation	Microgrids are smart electrical grid composed of the communication network among its power devices for better operation and control. The information sharing is done locally through measurement but globally by adopting a protocol over the communication network for fast and reliable information exchange for microgrid protection and coordination among the devices present in the power network. In this article, a real-time simulation of a smart microgrid with the emulation of the intelligent electronic devices present in the grid that takes action over the events is proposed using the hardware-in-the-loop methodology. The information exchange between the simulated microgrid and the emulated intelligent trip unit of the circuit breaker is adopted using a physical communication network and User datagram protocol over Ethernet. The unique aspect is to approach the problem of co-simulating the power system simulator with the communication network without platform dependencies to obtain more realistic results. The mathematical models are created using model-based design approach with which a C code can be generated and can be simulated in real-time with any of the digital twins available. The proposed framework is used to test a protection scenario in the microgrid that exchanges the information over Ethernet for measurement and action coordination with the emulated trip unit for stable operation of the microgrid.

362	DTCPS	Networked HIL Simulation System for Modeling Large-scale Power Systems	This paper presents a networked hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation system for modeling large-scale power systems. Researchers have developed many HIL test systems for power systems in recent years. Those test systems can model both microsecond-level dynamic responses of power electronic systems and millisecond-level transients of transmission and distribution grids. By integrating individual HIL test systems into a network of HIL test systems, we can create large-scale power grid digital twins with flexible structures at required modeling resolution that fits for a wide range of system operating conditions. This will not only significantly reduce the need for field tests when developing new technologies but also greatly shorten the model development cycle. In this paper, we present a networked OPAL-RT based HIL test system for developing transmission-distribution coordinative Volt-VAr regulation technologies as an example to illustrate system setups, communication requirements among different HIL simulation systems, and system connection mechanisms. Impacts of communication delays, information exchange cycles, and computing delays are illustrated. Simulation results show that the performance of a networked HIL test system is satisfactory.

In this paper, we present a networked OPAL-RT based HIL test system for developing transmission-distribution coordinative Volt-VAr regulation technologies as an example to illustrate system setups, communication requirements among different HIL simulation systems, and system connection mechanisms. Impacts of communication delays, information exchange cycles, and computing delays are illustrated. Simulation results show that the performance of a networked HIL test system is satisfactory."",

363	DTCPS	Hierarchical Aggregation/Disaggregation for Adaptive Abstraction-Level Conversion in Digital Twin-Based Smart Semiconductor Manufacturing	In smart manufacturing, engineers typically analyze unexpected real-time problems using digitally cloned discrete-event (DE) models for wafer fabrication. To achieve a faster response to problems, it is essential to increase the speed of DE simulations because making optimal decisions for addressing the issues requires repeated simulations. This paper presents a hierarchical aggregation/disaggregation (A/D) method that substitutes complex event-driven operations with two-layered abstracted models-single-group mean-delay models (SMDMs) and multi-group MDMs (MMDMs)-to gain simulation speedup. The SMDM dynamically abstracts a DE machine group's behaviors into observed mean-delay constants when the group converges into a steady state. The MMDM fast-forwards the input lots by bypassing the chained processing steps in multiple steady-state groups until it schedules the lots for delivery to subsequent unsteady groups after corresponding multi-step mean delays. The key component, the abstraction-level converter (ALC), has the roles of MMDM allocation, deallocation, extension, splitting, and controls the flow of each group's input lot by deciding the destination DE model, SMDM, and MMDMs. To maximize the reuse of previously computed multi-step delays for the dynamically changing MMDMs, we propose an efficient method to manage the delays using two-level caches. Each steady-state group's ALC performs statistical testing to detect the lot-arrival change to reactivate the DE model. However, fast-forwarding (FF) results in incorrect test results of the bypassed group's ALCs due to the missed observations of the bypassed lots. Thus, we propose a method for test-sample reinitialization that considers the bypassing. Moreover, since a bypassed group's unexpected divergence can change the multi-step delays of previously scheduled events, a method for examination of FF history is designed to trace the highly influenced events. This proposed method has been applied in various case studi...

364	DTCPS	Digital Twins-Based Online Monitoring of TFE-731 Turbofan Engine Using Fast Orthogonal Search	Due to the complicated structure of the aircraft engine, it is hard to observe the damage and determine its status with the traditional diagnosis method, which sets a fixed threshold for some specific parameters. To accurately reflect the condition of the engine, this article provides a novel fault diagnosis method for the TFE-731 turbofan engine and develops an online diagnosis system. With the combinations of model-based and data-driven approaches, models are constructed to create the so-called digital twins of the engine parameters. For the model-based approach, the physical isentropic compression is used as the basis of the model. For the data-driven approach, the fast orthogonal search is utilized to ensure that the model outputs close to the real engine data. Based on the model prediction-based monitoring strategy, the status of the engine can be identified online. By using the proposed method, an alarm will be triggered once the tested engine outputs cross the boundaries generated by the digital twins. This method can be further applied in quality control to examine the abnormal parts of an aircraft engine. Finally, the digital twins' online diagnosis system is realized in the practical TFE-731 test facility, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.

An accurate server-level model is critical to accomplish the well-represented date center digital twin. In this paper, IBM server models have been built with the back-pressure function enabled using detailed experimental testing data, including physical configurations, airflows, and power from servers with different functions. Flow differences in various server and rack configurations using the detailed digital twin models have been compared with the baseline simplified model in hot aisle containment and no containment data center. Flow rate reduction using the detailed model could be 42% in certain servers within the rack in the non-containment data center. It could further decrease to 50% in hot aisle containment data center compared to a simplified model - highlighting the importance of accurate digital twin models for data center planning. Additionally, the impact of server location within the rack has been studied. The study shows that servers placed lower in the rack have a higher flow rate reduction, which is not represented using a simplified model.

368	DTCPS	Implementation of a Bi-Directional Digital Twin for Industry 4 Labs in Academia: A Solution Based on OPC UA	With the increased demands of smarter manufacturing approaches around the world, the process of industrial digital transformation is being pushed in and by both industry and academia. Learning factories and testing laboratories have been developed for decades for teaching and training purposes in Academia. Nowadays, as the future trend in industry, Industry 4 is being merged into the latest development of learning factories and testing laboratories. This paper presents the development and implementation of a bi-directional digital twin application in an Industry 4 testing laboratory at University of South Australia. The solution is based on the establishment of OPC UA connection between two cobots of different brands, the use of NX Siemens as a CAD simulation platform and a SCADA system from Inductive Automation. Due to differences between system interfaces, communication between different modules was challenging. Python OPC UA servers were developed.

371	DTCPS	Digital Twinning Based Adaptive Development Environment for Automotive Cyber-Physical Systems	Automotive cyber-physical systems need to be rigorously checked and tested under various physical conditions. Automakers aim to improve development efficiency of the automotive cyber-physical systems in the fierce market competition. However, the actual development process suffers from the challenges of long development cycle and poor scalability. To tackle these challenges, this article develops a digital twinning based adaptive development environment for automotive cyber-physical systems, which addresses two critical problems: each physical entity (i.e., electronic control unit, component, test source, etc.) needs to clone a corresponding digital twin; digital twins and the physical entities need to interact closely. The first problem is addressed through proposing an integrated digital twinning clone flow. The second problem is addressed through developing a smart digital twinning board. Our case study with the automotive body control system demonstrates that the adaptive development environment achieves a high adaptability with short development cycle, low complexity, low cost, high scalability, and high flexibility, which meet various automotive cyber-physical design requirements during the development process.

373	DTCPS	Flexible and Efficient MMC Digital Twin Realized With Small-Scale Real-Time Simulators	The decreasing trend in the price of computational power has led to the evolution of various tools intended to support development processes in power electronics. In the domain of high-power converters, which rely on the use of digital controllers while switching at frequencies not exceeding several kHz, Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) systems have become widely adopted for commissioning and testing of control software. To put it differently, analog simulators or scaled-down versions of the same highpower converters have been replaced with HIL systems lately. Owing to the availability of computational power, HIL systems provide the means for high-fidelity real time simulations of the converter hardware parts. Connecting the dedicated controller, supposed to govern the hardware parts, to the Real-Time Simulator (RTS), through a suitable interface, gives control engineers the possibility to explore performances of various control algorithms without the controller ever realizing it drives the converter model, running on the employed RTS, instead of the real power hardware. Consequently, a risk-free environment for development and testing of control schemes is ensured, which is crucial especially if large and expensive systems, such as MW level power electronics converters, are considered. What is more, development of control algorithms and converter hardware parts can take place in parallel, as depicted in Figure 1, which reduces the development time of the converter as a whole.

374	DTCPS	Reduced Order Model of a Four Zone Medium Voltage DC Electric Ship	The models of multi-zone electric ship is important to the development of ship operational capability and performance. However, there is not one best model type that can fit all the needs of the engineering process. High-fidelity models are needed to act as a digital twin to the system hardware for testing and validation purposes. However, a highly detailed digital model of a MVDC does not enable insight and development of analytical control and optimization algorithms. This paper presents a reduced order model (ROM) of a notional four-zone medium voltage ship. This ROM can be written in a closed-form analytical expression that is appropriate for analysis and high-level supervisory control synthesis.

However, a highly detailed digital model of a MVDC does not enable insight and development of analytical control and optimization algorithms.

375	DTCPS	Next Generation X-in-the-Loop Validation Methodology for Automated Vehicle Systems	Testing self-driving vehicles is still a new and immature process; the globally harmonised procedure expected much later. The resource-demanding nature of real-world tests makes it indispensable to develop and improve the efficiency of virtual environment based testing methods. Accordingly, a novel X-in-the-Loop framework is proposed to fully exploit the recent advances in info-communication technologies, vehicle automation, and testing and validation requirements. This methodology real-time connects physical and virtual testing with high correlation while completely blurs the sharp boundaries between them. Measurement results confirm the superior performance of the 5G communication link in providing a stable, real-time connection between the real world and its virtual representation. The live demonstration proved the presented concept at the newly constructed Hungarian proving ground for automated driving. The performed investigation also includes comprehensive benchmarking, focusing on the most up-to-date automotive testing frameworks. The analysis considers the methodologies and techniques applied by the most relevant actors in the automotive testing sector worldwide. Accordingly, the newly developed testing framework is evaluated and validated in light of the state-of-the-art methods used by the automotive industry.

376	DTCPS	On the Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks for Live Modeling of Cyber-Physical Systems	Attention to cyber security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has led to the development of innovative cyber-resilient methodologies to ensure early detection and mitigation of cyber anomalies and threats. The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has recently emerged as one of the approaches to achieve the objective of resilience. In the approach using DT, a software-based live model of a target CPS is used to continuously monitor, surveil and verify the correctness of the target CPS operation. In this paper, we empirically study the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models as the basis of DT-based resilience. We uncover the important characteristics of an RNN-based solution with experimentation on a lab-scale Canal Lock CPS emulator with live validations and attack scenarios. For the first time, we demonstrate actual, real-time use of a RNN-based model as a DT for performing live analysis on an operational CPS. Based on the observed results, we highlight the importance of a DT model's training interval, prediction interval and CPS polling interval in the process of anomaly detection. We uncover the limitations in anomaly detection due to real-time synchronization needs of the RNN-based DT. We highlight this uncovered tug of war between synchronization and anomaly detection is inherent in any complex CPS that is monitored and synchronized by relying on the same sensor streams of ground truth for both synchronization as well as anomaly detection.

377	DTCPS	ELEGANT: Security of Critical Infrastructures With Digital Twins	The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.

378	DTCPS	Simulation-Based Digital Twin Development for Blockchain Enabled End-to-End Industrial Hemp Supply Chain Risk Management	With the passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, Industrial Hemp production is moved from limited pilot programs to a regulated agriculture production system. However, Industrial Hemp Supply Chain (IHSC) faces critical challenges, including high complexity and variability, very limited production knowledge, and lack of data/information tracking. In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a simulation-based digital twin for IHSC management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making. Our empirical study demonstrates the promising performance of proposed platform.

383	DTCPS	Roads Infrastructure Digital Twin: A Step Toward Smarter Cities Realization	Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360deg camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360deg live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360deg web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security. To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.

385	DTCPS	Method to Interface Grid-Forming Inverters into Power Hardware in the Loop Setups	During the last decade, utility companies around the world have experienced a significant increase in the occurrences of either planned or unplanned blackouts, and microgrids have emerged as a viable solution to improve grid resiliency and robustness. Recently, power converters with grid-forming capabilities have attracted interest from researchers and utilities as keystone devices enabling modern microgrid architectures. Therefore, proper and thorough testing of Grid-Forming Inverters (GFMIs) is crucial to understand their dynamics and limitations before they are deployed. The use of closed-loop real-time Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) simulations will facilitate the testing of GFMIs using a digital twin of the power system under various contingency scenarios within a controlled environment. So far, lower to medium scale commercially available GFMIs are difficult to interface into PHIL simulations because of their lack of a synchronization mechanism that allows a smooth and stable interconnection with a voltage source such as a power amplifier. Under this scenario, the use of the well-known Ideal Transformer Method to create a PHIL setup can lead to catastrophic damages of the GFMI. This paper addresses a simple but novel method to interface commercially available GFMIs into a PHIL testbed. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is stable and accurate under standalone operation with abrupt (step) load-changing dynamics, followed by the corresponding steady state behavior. Such results were validated against the dynamics of the GFMI connected to a linear load bank.

392	DTCPS	Optimal RUL Estimation: A State-of-Art Digital Twin Application	A real world Industrial IoT set up has paved way for simultaneous monitoring of several sensors at their unique sampling rates. This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques.

393	DTCPS	Meta-Information driven Modeling of Services for Experimentable Digital Twins	Experimental Digital Twins (EDT) provide a comprehensive view on the behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This is achieved by simulation technology and the application of virtual environments to develop and test desired functionality, including models, data structures, services and communication capabilities. This paper outlines a meta-information driven method of describing services provided by a CPS for consumption by peers via any means of communication. In addition, a set of application rules is presented, which handle cases such as service composition and the interaction of CPS components in distributed systems. We present the fundamental meta-information system that facilitates the specification process by providing the necessary type information for the dynamic object construction and automated (de-)serialization of data passed between provider and consumer.

394	DTCPS	Exploiting the Digital Twin in the Assessment and Optimization of Sustainability Performances	Digitalization has shown the potential to disrupt industrial value chains by supporting real-time, risk-free and inexpensive inputs to decision making towards enhanced companies' productivity and value networks flexibility. Developing a reliable and robust digital replica of the physical systems of the value chain is one of the most advanced (and challenging) approaches to digitalization, condensed in the concept of Digital Twin (DT). DT plays a fundamental role in creating a data-rich environment where simulation and optimization procedures can be run. With DT expected to become a commodity in the coming years, simulation and optimization become therefore a more accessible instrument for the improvement of manufacturing and business processes also in small enterprises with limited investment capacity. While scientific literature has analysed the adoption of DT in the optimization of products lifecycle, no contributions have yet focused on the exploitation of DT to improve the sustainability performances of whole value chains. In this paper we propose a reference framework where DTs built upon process and system data gathered from the field, allow to quickly assess the sustainability performances of both existing and planned production mixes and to compare achievable impacts with changing processes and technologies, thus enabling advisory features for sustainability-aware decision making in structured, multi-entity value networks. Internal validation will be deployed referring to real case studies.

395	DTCPS	Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing of Modern On-Board Power Systems Using Digital Twins	Simulation has always played an important role in the development, integration and deployment of aircraft, land vehicles and naval ships. Ever-increasing system design complexity also increased the necessity for more stringent testing and integration capabilities of these new topologies. Real-time simulators can be very useful tools to test, validate and integrate these complex devices. Maintenance and subsystem upgrades, common issues in such complex systems, cannot be easily done on the real systems, especially on larger systems like those in navy ships. This is when a real-time digital replica with Hardware-In-the-Loop capability is very useful. This type of system is also known as a 'Digital Twin'. This approach is compatible with model-based design; a design philosophy that is based entirely on simulation models, from the specifications to release and field commissioning. In this paper, we describe the Digital Twin approach and explain it in the context of navy ships. Such systems usually integrate many subsystems, such as traction systems, power generation and auxiliary systems, all connected through various communication links. The test and integration requirements for such vehicle or land systems affect several levels of the control hierarchy; from low-level power electronic converters used for propulsion and auxiliary systems to high-level supervisory controls. In this paper, we will describe a HIL test made on a simplified zonal power system of a navy ship.

396	DTCPS	Digital Twin for Human-Robot Interactive Welding and Welder Behavior Analysis	This paper presents an innovative investigation on prototyping a digital twin (DT) as the platform for human-robot interactive welding and welder behavior analysis. This human-robot interaction (HRI) working style helps to enhance human users' operational productivity and comfort; while data-driven welder behavior analysis benefits to further novice welder training. This HRI system includes three modules: 1) a human user who demonstrates the welding operations offsite with her/his operations recorded by the motion-tracked handles; 2) a robot that executes the demonstrated welding operations to complete the physical welding tasks onsite; 3) a DT system that is developed based on virtual reality (VR) as a digital replica of the physical human-robot interactive welding environment. The DT system bridges a human user and robot through a bi-directional information flow: a) transmitting demonstrated welding operations in VR to the robot in the physical environment; b) displaying the physical welding scenes to human users in VR. Compared to existing DT systems reported in the literatures, the developed one provides better capability in engaging human users in interacting with welding scenes, through an augmented VR. To verify the effectiveness, six welders, skilled with certain manual welding training and unskilled without any training, tested the system by completing the same welding job; three skilled welders produce satisfied welded workpieces, while the other three unskilled do not. A data-driven approach as a combination of fast Fourier transform (FFT), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM) is developed to analyze their behaviors.

397	DTCPS	Industrial IoT and Digital Twins for a Smart Factory : An open source toolkit for application design and benchmarking	The rapid evolution of digital technology and designed intelligence, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), has been a catalyst for the 4th industrial revolution (known as industry 4.0). Among other, the two key state-of-the-art concepts in Industry 4.0, are Industrial IoT (IIoT) and digital twins. IIoT facilitates real-time data acquisition, processing and analytics over large amount of sensor data streams produced by sensors installed within a smart factory, while the 'digital twin' concept aims to enable smart factories via the digital replication or representation of physical machines, processes, people in cyber-space. This paper explores the capability of present-state open-source platforms to collectively achieve digital twin capabilities, including IoT real-time data acquisition, virtual representation, analytics, and visualisation. The aim of this work is to 'close the gap' between research and implementation, through a collective open source IoT and Digital Twin architecture. The performance of the open-source architecture in this work, is demonstrated in a use-case utilising industry 'open data', and is bench-marked with universal testing tools.

400	DTCPS	Examination of the Effectiveness of Mode Orthogonalisation and Filtering for Scattering Suppression in Antenna Measurements Through Computational Electromagnetic Simulation	Reflections in antenna measurement ranges generally comprise the most significant term within the overall uncertainty budget [1], [2]. For well over a decade now, a frequency domain mode filtering based measurement technique has been utilized to significantly reduce range reflections within antenna test systems [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. More recently however, this technique has been adapted so that it could also be used with far-field and compact antenna measurement systems [9], [10], [1] with the technique being firmly rooted in conventional cylindrical near-field theory [1]. Although this family of techniques was initially intended to provide a means by which the lower frequency limit of operation of a given facility [3], [4] could be extended downwards to work effectively in applications where the operation would otherwise be impaired by the fixed physical size of the absorber and therefore predetermined electrical performance, these techniques have more recently been used very successfully to improve performance at the upper end of the frequency extent [11]. Although this technique has been extensively examined and verified empirically by means of range measurements, relatively little verification by means of computational electromagnetic simulation is available in the open literature [1], [12], [13], [14], [15]. In this paper, we developed an efficient computational electromagnetic (CEM) model of the measurement configuration, i.e. a digital twin, using a three-dimensional, full-wave CEM solver. The purpose of this is to construct an absolute truth-model to provide a firm basis for a detailed quantitative examination of the scattering suppression technique. The modelling technique is discussed in detail and initial results are presented which show very good agreement between the 'true' far-field pattern of the antenna in free space and that of the far-field of the antenna when perturbed with the presence of a scatterer and applying the scattering suppression process.

402	DTCPS	Design, Modeling, and Experimental Verification of a Hall-Effect-Based Linear Instrumentation System for Through-Shaft Angle Sensing	This article presents a simple instrumentation system for sensing the angular position of a through shaft. The system, broadly, consists of two parts: 1) a Hall-effect-based sensor module (SM) consisting of a twin eccentric-disc rotating arrangement and 2) a linearizing digital converter (LDC), which acts as an efficient interface for the transducer part. The SM provides cubic-natured push-pull outputs with respect to the angle. The linearizer further accepts these signals, performs a voltage-to-frequency transformation, and then applies novel linearization function to render a linear direct-digital indication of the angle. The article discusses the design and theoretical modeling of the SM, and its characteristics are derived. The sensor characteristics observed from simulation are in agreement with theoretical studies. Simulations are also extended to study the effect of important mechanical/magnetic parameters of the SM. Optimal parameter values are also inferred from these studies. The LDC and associated methodologies are also studied and presented in the article. The performance of the instrumentation system is validated using a hardware model of the SM and a prototype of the LDC. The experimental results show that the sensor and linearizer work as expected. Interfacing tests show that the overall instrumentation system gives an accuracy of less than 0.4% and a resolution of 0.2deg over a wide range.

    abstract = ""This article presents a simple instrumentation system for sensing the angular position of a through shaft. The system, broadly, consists of two parts: 1) a Hall-effect-based sensor module (SM) consisting of a twin eccentric-disc rotating arrangement and 2) a linearizing digital converter (LDC), which acts as an efficient interface for the transducer part. The SM provides cubic-natured push-pull outputs with respect to the angle. The linearizer further accepts these signals, performs a voltage-to-frequency transformation, and then applies novel linearization function to render a linear direct-digital indication of the angle. The article discusses the design and theoretical modeling of the SM, and its characteristics are derived. The sensor characteristics observed from simulation are in agreement with theoretical studies. Simulations are also extended to study the effect of important mechanical/magnetic parameters of the SM. Optimal parameter values are also inferred from these studies. The LDC and associated methodologies are also studied and presented in the article. The performance of the instrumentation system is validated using a hardware model of the SM and a prototype of the LDC. The experimental results show that the sensor and linearizer work as expected. Interfacing tests show that the overall instrumentation system gives an accuracy of less than 0.4\% and a resolution of 0.2deg over a wide range."",

406	DTCPS	Controller-Embeddable Probabilistic Real-Time Digital Twins for Power Electronic Converter Diagnostics	In this article, an approach is proposed for the online diagnostic analysis of power electronic converters utilizing real-time, probabilistic digital twinning. Under this approach, a digital twin (DT) of a power converter is defined as a real-time, probabilistic simulation model with stochastic (random) variables, developed using generalized polynomial chaos expansion. The DT models are partitioned in perspective of control layers for power converter subsystems in the approach, with emphasis on the application and converter control layers. Real-time executed solvers of these divided probabilistic DT models are embedded into power converter controllers running on field programmable gate array (FPGA) computing devices. Using a monitoring system, the real-time probabilistic DTs at each control layer and the corresponding physical twins of the power converter are compared by the controllers to determine if the power converter is operating within probable behavior. Knowing the large computational cost of probabilistic modeling, the resource usage and timing of real-time DT solvers on modern FPGAs is reported for common power electronic converter topologies, showing the approach is feasible and able to perform probabilistic real-time simulation of smaller power converters in perspective of application and converter control layers using <=2 ms time steps, with as low as 70 ns steps; while staying embeddable within FPGA-based controllers. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed approach, a case study is presented using a probabilistic DT in the application layer controller of a pair of converters to comparatively monitor their behavior and corresponding controller action under hardware-in-the-loop testing.

407	DTCPS	High performance wideband digital predistortion platform for 3G+ applications with better than 55dBc over 40 MHz bandwidth	In this paper, a hardware-software system is proposed for the wideband characterization and linearization of power amplifiers exhibiting memory effects. The designed prototype includes a signal generation and a feedback paths for applications in the 1GHz to 2.5GHz frequency band and supports instantaneous bandwidths of up to 60MHz. The hardware platform is coupled with a software interface that implements the required data processing algorithms for the synthesis of the digital predistortion function. Experimental validation is carried out on a 3G power amplifier driven by an eight-carrier WCDMA signal. The digital predistortion is implemented using the twin-nonlinear two-box model with only 30 parameters and leads to a better than 55dBc ACLR for an input signal having 40MHz instantaneous bandwidth.

The designed prototype includes a signal generation and a feedback paths for applications in the 1GHz to 2.5GHz frequency band and supports instantaneous bandwidths of up to 60MHz. The hardware platform is coupled with a software interface that implements the required data processing algorithms for the synthesis of the digital predistortion function. Experimental validation is carried out on a 3G power amplifier driven by an eight-carrier WCDMA signal. The digital predistortion is implemented using the twin-nonlinear two-box model with only 30 parameters and leads to a better than 55dBc ACLR for an input signal having 40MHz instantaneous bandwidth.

408	DTCPS	Digital Twin Models of Power Electronic Converters Using Dynamic Neural Networks	This paper presents a new approach for creating real-time models of power electronic converters using dynamic neural networks. The models are time-domain, switch-averaged, large-signal, real-time, and embeddable. This combination of characteristics renders the model uniquely suited to create digital twins of the converter which can run on any platform, including locally on the converter's digital controller. The training dataset for the proposed neural network model can be generated from simulation (rather than measured on a hardware prototype) for convenience. This work will suggest a rationale for choosing the neural network structure and hyperparameters, will discuss best practices for training and testing the model, and will include an analysis of model error.

410	DTCPS	DUET: A Framework for Building Interoperable and Trusted Digital Twins of Smart Cities	Digital twins have generated a lot of hype recently, but questions remain about what the technology actually means and how one can be built for smart cities. There is a lack of unified models and frameworks for data fusions that link the physical and virtual data exchange. This can undermine the uptake of digital twin technology by cities that are unable to tackle urban problems with advanced data-driven solutions. The T-Cell framework developed by the DUET project acts as a container for models, data, and simulations that interact dynamically in a common environment and provide useful insights for smart city decision makers. Dynamic correspondence that links the architecture with models and data makes it possible to monitor and synchronize the state and behavior of the digital twin with the physical environment being mirrored. Individual models are integrated through APIs to form a cloud of models that can be called upon to perform various what-if analyses related to traffic, air quality, or noise pollution. The framework is currently being tested with citizens in three locations in Europe, but it is easily replicable so that any city, no matter its size, vcan leverage the power of digital twins to achieve its policy goals.

413	DTCPS	Enhancing Digital Twins through Reinforcement Learning	Digital Twins are core enablers of smart and autonomous manufacturing systems. Although they strive to represent their physical counterpart as accurately as possible, slight model or data errors will remain. We present an algorithm to compensate for those residual errors through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and data fed back from the manufacturing system. When learning, the Digital Twin acts as teacher and safety policy to ensure minimal performance. We test the algorithm in a sheet metal assembly context, in which locators of the fixture are optimally adjusted for individual assemblies. Our results show a fast adaption and improved performance of the autonomous system.

414	DTCPS	Exploring Virtual Reality as an Integrated Development Environment for Cyber-Physical Systems	Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) development approaches tend to start from the physical (hardware) perspective, and the software is the final element in the process. However, this approach is unfit for the more software-intensive world that is increasingly iterative, connected, and constantly online. Many constraints prevent the application of iterative, incremental, and agile development methodologies, which now are the norm for many other fields of software. Time-consuming system validation can only start when both hardware and software components are ready, which implies that the software delivery and quality is almost always the final bottleneck in the CPS development and integration. Also organizational issues raise concerns - CPS development teams are nowadays often geographically distributed, which can result in delays in the process, shortcomings, and even mistakes. In this paper, we propose using our envisioned open-source Virtual Reality-based Integrated software Development Environment (VRIDE) for developing the next generation, increasingly software-intensive CPSs in efficient ways.

With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control.

420	DTCPS	Digital Twin-based Anomaly Detection in Cyber-physical Systems	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are susceptible to various anomalies during their operations. Thus, it is important to detect such anomalies. Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively. Moreover, ATTAIN achieved on average 8.39% increase in the anomaly detection capability with digital twins as compared with an approach of not using digital twins.

422	DTCPS	Digital Twin Extension with Extra-Functional Properties	Digital twins of production lines do not focus solely on the management of the production process, they can also monitor and optimize other extra-functional aspects such as energy consumption and communications. This paper proposes the extension of digital twin concept in such directions. First, we extend the digital twin with models of energy consumption, that allow the monitoring of production line components throughout production lifetime. Then, we propose a flow to design the communication network starting from information obtained from the digital twin concerning the production, usage and flowing of information through the plant. All these methodologies start from the production line specification, then they enrich it with data collected during operation, and finally information is used to perform design and optimization. Results have been shown on a real Industry 4.0 research facility.

423	DTCPS	DigiMobot: Digital Twin for Human-Robot Collaboration in Indoor Environments	Human-robot collaboration and cooperation are critical for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in order to use them in indoor environments, such as offices, hospitals, libraries, schools, factories, and warehouses. Since a long transition period might be required to fully automate such facilities, we have to deploy AMRs while improving safety in the mixed environments of human and mobile robots. In addition, human behaviors in such environments might be difficult to predict. In this paper, we present a Digital Twin for Autonomous Mobile Robots system named DigiMobot to support, manage, monitor, and validate AMRs in indoor environments. First, DigiMobot can simulate human behaviors and robot movements to verify and validate AMRs to improve safety in a virtual world. Secondly, DigiMobot can monitor and manage AMRs in the physical world by collecting sensor data from each robot in real-time. Since DigiMobot enables us to test the robot systems in the virtual world, we can deploy and implement AMRs in each facility without any modifications. To show the feasibility of DigiMobot, we develop a software framework and two different types of autonomous mobile robots. Finally, we conduct real-world experiments in a warehouse located in Saitama, Japan, in which more than 400, 000 items are stored for commercial purposes.

424	DTCPS	Cyber Protection of Grid-Connected Devices Through Embedded Online Security	Cybersecurity research regarding the electric power grid has primarily been focused on protecting the communication layer of grid-connected devices against cyber-attack threats. Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device's controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system.

425	DTCPS	Digital Twin Design for Thermal Power Plant Cooling System using Fuzzy System	With technological advances, the industrial sector is using enabling technologies based on the concepts of Industry 4.0, among them the modeling of systems based on Digital Twins, which allow building models of real physical systems from field measurements, with the ability to follow the dynamic system changes. This article describes the development of a digital twin for a cooling system based on data from the sensors of a thermal power plant. The digital twin created used data from a plant currently in operation at the major system, and the automatic rules extraction approach from the test database was used to form the model's knowledge database. The principal component analysis technique was used to reduce the dimensionality of the system to reduce the computational effort of the model. An algorithm for automatic update of rules during the operation of the digital twin was also proposed, making the model learn during the operation even without the need to retrain and, consequently, reduce error of the model's response in the short term.

This article describes the development of a digital twin for a cooling system based on data from the sensors of a thermal power plant. The digital twin created used data from a plant currently in operation at the major system, and the automatic rules extraction approach from the test database was used to form the model's knowledge database. The principal component analysis technique was used to reduce the dimensionality of the system to reduce the computational effort of the model. An algorithm for automatic update of rules during the operation of the digital twin was also proposed, making the model learn during the operation even without the need to retrain and, consequently, reduce error of the model's response in the short term."",

427	DTCPS	Design of a Low-Power Coprocessor for Mid-Size Vocabulary Speech Recognition Systems	Speech recognition systems have gained popularity in consumer electronics. This paper presents a custom-designed coprocessor for output probability calculation (OPC), which is the most computation-intensive processing step in continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM)-based speech recognition algorithms. To save hardware resource and reduce power consumption, a polynomial addition-based method is used to compute add-log instead of the traditional look-up table-based method. In addition, the optimal tradeoff between speech processing delay, energy consumption, and hardware resources is explored for the coprocessor. The proposed coprocessor has been implemented and tested in Xilinx Spartan-3A DSP XC3SD3400A, and also validated using the standard-cell-based approach in IBM 0.13 mm technology. To implement an entire speech recognition system, SAMSUNG S3C44b0X (containing an ARM7) is used as the micro-controller to execute the rest of speech processing. Tested with a 358-state 3-mixture 27-feature 800-word HMM, S3C44b0X operates at 40 MHz and coprocessor at 10 MHz to meet the real-time requirement, and the recognition accuracy is 95.2%. Power consumption of the micro-controller is 10 mW, and that of the coprocessor 15.2 mW. The overall speech recognition system achieves the lowest energy consumption per word recognition among many reported designs. Experiment and analysis show that the speech recognition system based on the proposed coprocessor is especially suitable for mid-size vocabulary (100-1000 words) recognition tasks.

428	DTCPS	Cyber Social FML - Computing I. Goal and Main Trends	The creation of the collective cyber-mind of mankind (the state) today passes through Federated Machine Learning technologies of unobtrusive, smart use of citizens and terminal devices. All this became possible thanks to the emergence of 5G communication channels, cloud structures, social networks, mobile devices and ingenious experts, initiating the creation of a tolerant digital world and the intelligence of the planet. A new cyber-social computing of relations between the state and citizens is proposed, which play the role of tolerant mechanisms of management and execution to create moral and material values, improve the quality of life and preserve the environment. Proposed author's or innovative computing solutions for diagnostics and online elimination of differences between folk traditions and legislation, which today makes it possible to eliminate social catastrophes in all countries of the world and save trillions of dollars for the development of the economy, infrastructure and social services. A universal xor-metric of the convolution of digital cyberspace is formed, which makes it possible to measure any cyber-social processes and phenomena, as well as to determine the degree of their difference for the recognition and elimination of social collisions. The model of Digital Twin Computing is considered, which is characterized by comparison of two ML-truth tables that model the ideal and real behavior of a person with metric assessments for social activity and significance, adopted in the community. An improved model-architecture of cyber-social FML-computing is proposed, which differs from the standard one by combining the learning process, testing, functioning and distribution of ML-terminals in space, which makes it possible to reduce the training time by an order of magnitude and improve the quality of services for recognition and decision-making when serving citizens.

431	DTCPS	Development of a computer twins-based wind farm testbed	As the contribution of wind energy to the power grid increases, serious concern about its influence on the dynamic behavior of the power system has also increased. This has raised the need for advanced analysis and simulation tools that can study the complicated dynamic behavior of wind turbines, test their controllers as well as emulate a complex power grid. Therefore, to meet all the aforementioned goals, a reconfigurable hybrid wind farm testbed has been developed and implemented into a real-time simulation platform that has eight CPUs. The proposed wind farm testbed includes a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) system involving a Doubly-fed Induction Machine (DFIM) test setup and wind turbine controllers. The wind farm model is also tested under normal and abnormal grid conditions. Several types of system symmetrical and asymmetrical faults are investigated. The first is a two-phase to ground fault at the point of common coupling (PCC) and the second is a three-phase to ground fault. An innovative approach referred to as Computer Twins is employed to react to these faults and maintain the stability of the power grid. A comprehensive set of test results are presented in this paper to demonstrate the capability of proposed testbed.

433	DTCPS	Condition Monitoring of Power Electronic Systems Through Data Analysis of Measurement Signals and Control Output Variables	A major disadvantage of existing condition monitoring methods is the need for additional sensors and measuring equipment. In this work, this disadvantage is eliminated by completely avoiding additional hardware. Instead, software-based methods from the field of machine learning are used. Therefore, measurement signals and control output variables are utilized, which are acquired and processed in any power electronic system for the purpose of converter control. The publication focuses on two main converter components: power semiconductors and dc-link capacitor. For each component, the aging mechanisms that have been studied in the literature are explained. Based on the aging mechanisms, the degradation indicators are identified. Then, a converter model is built that allows the variation of degradation indicators in order to analyze their effects on the available dataset. These findings form the basis for mathematical models, which detects future failure mechanisms of this type during converter operation. The test setup must offer the possibility of generating reproducible failure cases in various components with the aid of additional failure equipment. Finally, failure mechanisms are intentionally introduced at the test bench in order to validate the methodology of the developed approach.

434	DTCPS	Cooperative Federated Learning and Model Update Verification in Blockchain-Empowered Digital Twin Edge Networks	With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to connect physical components with digital space for better optimization of physical systems. However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction.

435	DTCPS	A Digital-Twin-Assisted Fault Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning	Digital twin is a significant way to achieve smart manufacturing, and provides a new paradigm for fault diagnosis. Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented. The results show the superiority and feasibility of our proposed method.

437	DTCPS	Cyber-Physical Data Fusion in Surrogate- Assisted Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm for PHEV Energy Management Optimization	"This article proposes a new form of algorithm environment for the multiobjective optimization of an energy management system in plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). The surrogate-assisted strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SSPEA) is developed to optimize the power-split control parameters guided by the data from the physical PHEV and its digital twins (DTs). By introducing a ""confidence factor,"" the SSPEA uses the fused data of physically measured and virtually simulated vehicle performances (energy consumption and remaining battery state of charge) to converge the optimization process. Gaussian noisy models are adopted to emulate the real vehicle system on the hardware-in-the-loop platform for experimental evaluation. The testing results suggest that the proposed SSPEA requires less R&D costs than the model-free method that only uses the physical information, and more than 44.6% energy can be saved during the R&D process. Driven by the SSPEA, the optimized energy management system surpasses other non-DT-assisted systems by saving more than 4.8% energy."

    abstract = ""This article proposes a new form of algorithm environment for the multiobjective optimization of an energy management system in plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). The surrogate-assisted strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SSPEA) is developed to optimize the power-split control parameters guided by the data from the physical PHEV and its digital twins (DTs). By introducing a ""confidence factor,"" the SSPEA uses the fused data of physically measured and virtually simulated vehicle performances (energy consumption and remaining battery state of charge) to converge the optimization process. Gaussian noisy models are adopted to emulate the real vehicle system on the hardware-in-the-loop platform for experimental evaluation. The testing results suggest that the proposed SSPEA requires less R\&D costs than the model-free method that only uses the physical information, and more than 44.6\% energy can be saved during the R\&D process. Driven by the SSPEA, the optimized energy management system surpasses other non-DT-assisted systems by saving more than 4.8\% energy."",

440	DTCPS	Application Status and Prospect of Digital Twin for On-Orbit Spacecraft	With cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and other new information technologies going into space, the era of space intelligence is coming. The spacecraft is facing more frequent and multi-task tests in an unprecedented complex environment, which set higher requirements for self-management. The current challenge lies in how to further build an integrated system of the virtual and physical space for spacecraft. In this tendency, the integration of Digital twin(DT) with spacecraft is also in its evolutionary trend. DT provides a data and model-based systematic approach for operation and management in the entire service life of on-orbit spacecraft. In this context, as a basic space system entity, the method of constructing DT of spacecraft is explored in this paper. Firstly, the concept of Spacecraft Digital twin (SDT) is put forward and four stages of simulation development are discussed from the perspective of DT. Moreover, the conceptual structure of four-dimensional model is proposed to adapt spatial distribution. After that, the key problems of SDT are discussed, including data acquisition, system configuration, and data service model. Accordingly, the future intelligent applications of spacecraft based on DT in autonomous cognition, autonomous operation and maintenance, as well as cluster collaboration are presented respectively.

First, sort out the evolution model of the improvement area, clarify its roadmap, and then use digital twins or other numerical simulation methods to verify the concept and principle. When the corresponding product is developed, it will be deployed in the verification airport for testing. After the function and performance of the product meet the requirements, add it to the product library for selection. Through the above process, current problems could be handled, meanwhile, the evolution model can be continuously optimized and keep the roadmap advanced. The simulation and verification work can fully use the existing digital and physical resources to form an ecology to promote and guarantee the development of the aviation industry.

First, sort out the evolution model of the improvement area, clarify its roadmap, and then use digital twins or other numerical simulation methods to verify the concept and principle. When the corresponding product is developed, it will be deployed in the verification airport for testing. After the function and performance of the product meet the requirements, add it to the product library for selection. Through the above process, current problems could be handled, meanwhile, the evolution model can be continuously optimized and keep the roadmap advanced. The simulation and verification work can fully use the existing digital and physical resources to form an ecology to promote and guarantee the development of the aviation industry."",

447	DTCPS	Cognitive Digital Twin for Manufacturing Systems	A digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and autonomy of machines and products. Hence, the digital twin has been projected as the key enabler of the Visions of Industry 4.0. The digital twin concept has become increasingly sophisticated and capable over time, enabled by many technologies. In this paper, we propose the cognitive digital twin as the next stage of advancement of a digital twin that will help realize the vision of Industry 4.0. Cognition, which is inspired by advancements in cognitive science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, will enable a digital twin to achieve some critical elements of cognition, e.g., attention (selective focusing), perception (forming useful representations of data), memory (encoding and retrieval of information and knowledge), etc. Our main thesis is that cognitive digital twins will allow enterprises to creatively, effectively, and efficiently exploit implicit knowledge drawn from the experience of existing manufacturing systems and enable the transfer of higher performance decisions and control and improve the performance across the enterprise (at scale). Finally, we present open questions and challenges to realize these capabilities in a digital twin.

450	DTCPS	Advance Estimate-based Traffic State Synchronization for Parallel Testing	Digital twins and parallel system have already been regarded as one of the most effective approaches that give a great impetus to the development of transportation system, especially for the testing of vehicle intelligence. State synchronization, as the main influencer of real-time interaction in a parallel system, determines the testing accuracy and computational efficiency. Despite the fact that the synchronization control is already a well-explored field, the traffic state synchronization in the application of the vehicle testing via virtual-real interaction is still a topic for further research. In this paper, to achieve better synchronization, a path generation method based on the Frenet frame is firstly designed to decompose the object's motion into the longitudinal and lateral directions, and achieves the trajectory tracking based on the near real-time data sent from the physical space. Then to eliminate the stochastic latency, the advance estimate-based path modification method is proposed to generate a stretch of path in advance. Finally, the integrated approach is implemented in a testing platform and the experimental results prove that the proposed method improves the synchronous rate by an average of 78.4% and 63.7% in the scenario of straight driving and lane changing.

However, there is a lack of efficient strategies and comprehensive approaches for managing assets and their associated data that can help to monitor, detect, record, and communicate operation and maintenance (O&M) issues. With the importance of Digital Twin (DT) concepts being proven in the architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (AEC/FM) sectors, a DT-enabled anomaly detection system for asset monitoring and its data integration method based on extended industry foundation classes (IFC) in daily O&M management are provided in this study. This paper presents a novel IFC-based data structure, using which a set of monitoring data that carries diagnostic information on the operational condition of assets is extracted from building DTs. Considering that assets run under changing loads determined by human demands, a Bayesian change point detection methodology that handles the contextual features of operational data is adopted to identify and filter contextual anomalies through cross-referencing with external operation information. Using the centrifugal pumps in the heating, ventilation and air-cooling (HVAC) system as a case study, the results indicate and prove that the novel DT-based anomaly detection process flow realizes a continuous anomaly detection of pumps, which contributes to efficient and automated asset monitoring in O&M.
