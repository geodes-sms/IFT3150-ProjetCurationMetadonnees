0	DTCPS	Fiber orientation measurement from mesoscale CT scans of prepreg platelet molded composites	"X-ray computed tomography (CT) analysis is used to measure the heterogeneous fiber orientation fields in a 20 cm3 composite bracket made from prepreg platelet-based molding compound (PPMC). The as-molded mesostructure of the complete geometry is captured using material density gradients in 50 um resolution CT scans without the need to resolve individual fibers. Fiber collimation and physical density gradients within intact platelets of this material system facilitates nondestructive assessment of average local fiber orientation at the component scale. Microscopy-based validation of the local orientation measurements indicate the accuracy that can be attained utilizing the density-based structure tensor CT analysis method. Local orientation field measurements for the complete geometry can be mapped into a ""digital twin"" model, for purposes such as experimental performance simulation and validation of molding process orientation state predictions. Composite designers, analysts, and material suppliers can employ this methodology to more confidently utilize PPMCs and morphologically similar composite material systems."	A. Prepreg;  B.

2	DTCPS	Exploring critical success factors influencing adoption of digital twin and physical internet in electronics industry using grey-DEMATEL approach	Digital twin and physical internet adoption based on advanced digital technologies is gaining significance in the recent times. Digital twin is one of the enabling technologies that link actual physical system with its virtual depiction using advanced digital technologies. In order to leverage its potential, firms have instigated to adopt digital twin and physical internet for real-world applications. Although researches on impact of information technology in supply chains exists, a study on the modelling aspects by analysing critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet is limited. We have addressed this gap by developing a structural model for identifying the inter-relationships and cause effect parameters of critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet. Thirteen critical success factors were shortlisted based on literature review and in consultation with experts. An integrated Grey- based, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)is used to visualize the causal relationships among critical success factors and verified by applying the proposed model in an electronics manufacturing firm. Sensitivity analysis has been done to check accuracy of results and robustness of the study. The results reveal that top management commitment and support and long, medium and short term planning are the most influential factors impacting the adoption of digital twin and physical internet in electronics industry. Findings of this research provide insights for supply chain managers and academicians by identifying the cause and effect group critical success factors for effective adoption of digital twin and physical internet.

3	DTCPS	Error identification of measurement software based on digital twin of gear measuring center	The verification of measurement software has become a challenge as more types of workpiece being measured with gear measuring centers and the increasing complexity of measurement software. In this research, the digital twin of a gear measuring center (DTGMC) was constructed as an evaluation platform for various types of measurement software. Various digital workpieces instead of physical artifacts were measured on the DTGMC. Based on this platform, the evaluation methods for the measurement software were discussed, and three experiments were carried out. The involute measurement model was identified using multiple digital workpieces with known errors. The probe compensation algorithm was identified using different radii probes and a pin. Three position compensation algorithms were also verified using loading different motion errors. The results showed that the evaluation methods based on the DTGMC could effectively identify various errors in measurement software, providing a new concept for the independent evaluation of measurement software.

5	DTCPS	Digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of flow-type smart manufacturing systems	The COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that dramatically impacted human lives and economic activities. Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.

This paper presents a cloud battery management system for battery systems to improve the computational power and data storage capability by cloud computing. With the Internet of Things, all battery relevant data are measured and transmitted to the cloud seamlessly, building up the digital twin for the battery system, where battery diagnostic algorithms evaluate the data and open the window into battery's charge and aging level. The application of equivalent circuit models in the digital twin for battery systems is explored with the development of cloud-suited state-of-charge and state-of-health estimation approaches. The proposed state-of-charge estimation with an adaptive extended H-infinity filter is robust and accurate for both lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries, even with a significant initialization error. Furthermore, a state-of-health estimation algorithm with particle swarm optimization is innovatively exploited to monitor both capacity fade and power fade of the battery during aging. The functionalities and stability of both hardware and software of the cloud battery management system are validated with prototypes under field operation and experimental validation for both stationary and mobile applications.

8	DTCPS	Digital twin-enabled Graduation Intelligent Manufacturing System for fixed-position assembly islands	The layout of fixed-position assembly islands is widely used in the heavy equipment industry, where the product remains at one assembly island for its entire assembly period, while required workers, equipment, and materials are moved to the island according to the assembly plan. Such layout is not only suitable for producing bulky or fragile products, but also offers considerable flexibility and competitive operational efficiency for products with medium variety and volumes. However, due to inherent complexity of the product, sophisticated assembly operations heavily rely on skilled operators, and the complexity and uncertainty are high and amplified by such massive manual interventions as well as the unique routing patterns of the fixed-position assembly process. Aiming at reducing the complexity and uncertainty, this paper introduces a digital twin-enabled Graduation Intelligent Manufacturing System (DT-GiMS) for fixed-position assembly islands. Inspired by the success of graduation ceremony, an assembly system-Graduation Manufacturing System (GMS) is proposed for fixed-position assembly islands, in which job tickets, setup tickets, operation tickets, and logistics tickets are designed to organize the production activities. Following the concept of digital twin, unified digital representations with appropriate sets of information are created at object level, product level, and system level, respectively. Through Internet of Things (IoT), smart gateway, Web 3D and industrial wearable technologies, vital information including identity, status, geometric model, and production process can be captured and mapped in physical space, and converged and synchronized with their digital representations in twin (cloud) space on a real-time basis. The overall framework of DT-GiMS is presented with physical layer, digital layer, and service layer. Real-time convergence and synchronization among them ensure that right resources are allocated and utilized to the right activities at the right time with enhanced visibility. Considering customer demand and production capacity constraints, real-time ticket pool management mechanisms are proposed to manage production activities in a near-optimal way under DT-GiMS. With the support of cloud-based services provided in service layer in DT-GiMS, managers could easily make production decisions, and onsite operators could efficiently complete their daily tasks with nearly error-free operations with enhanced visibility. A demonstrative case is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed concept and approach.

9	DTCPS	Digital twin-driven rapid reconfiguration of the automated manufacturing system via an open architecture model	Increasing individualization demands in products call for high flexibility in the manufacturing systems to adapt changes. This paper proposes a novel digital twin-driven approach for rapid reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems. The digital twin comprises two parts, the semi-physical simulation that maps data of the system and provides input data to the second part, which is optimization. The results of the optimization part are fed back to the semi-physical simulation for verification. Open-architecture machine tool (OAMT) is defined and developed as a new class of machine tools comprising a fixed standard platform and various individualized modules that can be added and rapidly swapped. Engineers can flexibly reconfigure the manufacturing system for catering to process planning by integrating personalized modules into its OAMTs. Key enabling techniques, including how to twin cyber and physical system and how to quickly bi-level program the production capacity and functionality of manufacturing systems to adapt rapid changes of products, are detailed. A physical implementation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach to achieving improved system performance while minimizing the overheads of the reconfiguration process by automating and rapidly optimizing it.

    abstract = ""Increasing individualization demands in products call for high flexibility in the manufacturing systems to adapt changes. This paper proposes a novel digital twin-driven approach for rapid reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems. The digital twin comprises two parts, the semi-physical simulation that maps data of the system and provides input data to the second part, which is optimization. The results of the optimization part are fed back to the semi-physical simulation for verification. Open-architecture machine tool (OAMT) is defined and developed as a new class of machine tools comprising a fixed standard platform and various individualized modules that can be added and rapidly swapped. Engineers can flexibly reconfigure the manufacturing system for catering to process planning by integrating personalized modules into its OAMTs. Key enabling techniques, including how to twin cyber and physical system and how to quickly bi-level program the production capacity and functionality of manufacturing systems to adapt rapid changes of products, are detailed. A physical implementation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach to achieving improved system performance while minimizing the overheads of the reconfiguration process by automating and rapidly optimizing it.""

10	DTCPS	Construction method of shop-floor digital twin based on MBSE	"Digital twin (DT) technology is essential for achieving the fusion of virtual-real cyber-physical systems. Academics and companies have made great strides in the theoretical research and case studies of constructing the shop-floor digital twin (SDT), which is the premise of applying DT technology on the shop floor. A shop floor is a large complex system that involves many elements including people, machines, materials, methods, and the environment and processes, such as the technical flow, business process, logistics, and control flow. However, most of the developed cases lack a hierarchical, structured and modularized implementation framework for the development of an SDT system, which leads to problems such as a low reuse rate of the system blocks, lack of scalability, and high upgrade and maintenance costs. In response to these issues, we propose a construction method of the DT for the shop floor based on model-based systems engineering from the perspective of the system. In this method, a comprehensive DT model for the shop floor is gradually constructed by using system modeling language, the modeling method ""MagicGrid,"" and the ""V model"" of systems engineering. The model includes four dimensions of the shop-floor requirements, structure, behavior, and parameters, as well as three stages (the problem domain, solution domain, and implementation domain), and connects nine steps of the ""V model,"" including the system requirements, system architecture, subsystem implementation, subsystem integration, and system verification. Then, based on an example of a real NC machining shop floor, subsystems including a visualization system, synchronization system, and simulation system, are discussed. Finally, the functions of the integrated systems are verified based on the requirements, including the real-time synchronization of ""man, machine, material, and method"" and the transient simulation in real time.

13	DTCPS	Digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability for complex products	Complex products such as satellites, missiles, and aircraft typically have demanding requirements for dynamic data management and process traceability. The assembly process for these complex products involves high complexity, strong dynamics, many uncertainties, and frequent rework and repair, especially in the model development stage. Achieving assembly data management and process traceability for complex products has always been a challenge. A recently proposed solution involves one-to-one mapping of the corresponding physical entity, also known as the digital twin method. This paper proposes a digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability approach for complex products. First, the dynamic evolutionary process of complex product assembly data was analyzed from three dimensions: granularity, period and version. Then, a framework of digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability for complex products was constructed. Some core techniques are: 1) workflow-based product assembly data organization and version management; 2) synchronous modeling of the product assembly process based on digital twin; and 3) hierarchical management and traceability of product assembly data based on digital twin. On this basis, an algorithm flowchart for generating a product assembly data package was created, which includes product assembly data management, assembly process traceability, and generation of a product assembly data package. Furthermore, the Digital Twin-based Assembly Process Management and Control System (DT-APMCS) was designed to verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. Some aerospace-related assembly enterprises are currently using DT-APMCS and achieving satisfactory results. Finally, a summary of our work is given, and the future research work is also discussed.

14	DTCPS	Bi-level dynamic scheduling architecture based on service unit digital twin agents	Pure reactive scheduling is one of the core technologies to solve the complex dynamic disturbance factors in real-time. The emergence of CPS, digital twin, cloud computing, big data and other new technologies based on the industrial Internet enables information acquisition and pure reactive scheduling more practical to some extent. However, how to build a new architecture to solve the problems which traditional dynamic scheduling methods cannot solve becomes a new research challenge. Therefore, this paper designs a new bi-level distributed dynamic workshop scheduling architecture, which is based on the workshop digital twin scheduling agent and multiple service unit digital twin scheduling agents. Within this architecture, scheduling a physical workshop is decomposed to the whole workshop scheduling in the first level and its service unit scheduling in the second level. On the first level, the whole workshop scheduling is executed by its virtual workshop coordination (scheduling) agent embedded with the workshop digital twin consisting of multi-service unit digital twins. On the second level, each service unit scheduling coordinated by the first level scheduling is executed in a distributed way by the corresponding service unit scheduling agent associated with its service unit digital twin. The benefits of the new architecture include (1) if a dynamic scheduling only requires a single service unit scheduling, it will then be performed in the corresponding service unit scheduling without involving other service units, which will make the scheduling locally, simply and robustly. (2) when a dynamic scheduling requires changes in multiple service units in a coordinated way, the first level scheduling will be executed and then coordinate the second level service unit scheduling accordingly. This divide-and-then-conquer strategy will make the scheduling easier and practical. The proposed architecture has been tested to illustrate its feasibility and practicality.

A serial procedure is followed starting from the system's physical description, continuing to the dynamic analysis of independent models, and concluding with an experimental validation. The biped's mechanical model is tailored to preserve passive walker key functionalities without sacrificing design simplicity. The mechanical model gives rise to a mathematical model that describes the biped's gait, and to a multibody dynamics model of the biped. A passive biped robot prototype is developed based on the model. The prototype is equipped with a wireless sensor measuring system to enable data acquisition. The highlight of this work is the high degree of coincidence achieved between the passive response of the numerically simulated mathematical model, the response obtained by a multibody dynamics simulation, and the experimentally obtained response of the physical passive walking robot.

22	DTCPS	A generic tri-model-based approach for product-level digital twin development in a smart manufacturing environment	AbstractSmart manufacturing, as an emerging manufacturing paradigm, leverages massive in-context data frommanufacturing systemsforintelligent decision makings. In such context, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a key role in digitizingmanufacturing systemsand integrating multiple systems together forcollaborative works. Amongst different levels of smartness and connectedness of CPS,Digital Twin(DT), as an exact digital copy of aphysical objector system including its properties and relationship with the environment, has a significant impact on realizing smart manufacturing. A DT constantly synchronizes with itsphysical systemand provides real-time high-fidelity simulations of the system and offers ubiquitous control over the system. Despite its great advantages, few works have been discussed about DT reference models, let alone a generic manner to establish it for smart manufacturing. Aiming to fill the gap, this research introduces a generic CPSsystem architecturefor DT establishment in smart manufacturing with a novel tri-model-based approach (i.e. digital model,computational modeland graph-based model) for product-level DT development. The tri-model works concurrently to simulate real-world physical behaviour and characteristics of the digital model. To validate the proposed architecture and approach, acase studyof an open source 3D printer DT establishment is further conducted. Conclusions and future works are also highlighted to provide insightful knowledge to both academia and industries at last.

An application prototype based on a Digital Twin as Service Provider for a 4.0 knowledge fruition has been designed and developed to enable operators facing the highly dynamic factory floor and to have their 'virtual eyes and hands' on the physical system. The application has been deployed in a real factory floor and test results show its potential benefits on the industrial performances in terms of productivity (cycle and setup times) and of process quality standards (production waste rate).

27	DTCPS	Using finite element analysis to develop a digital twin of a manufacturing bending operation	AbstractIn smart manufacturing, a digital twin is the virtual counterpart of a physical manufacturing system and can be considered as having three elements: machine, product and process. To demonstrate this concept, a physical manufacturing testbed was developed which bends metal into V-brackets alongside a digital twin counterpart consisting of the three elements. The process digital twin uses finite element modelling to predict product stress during the bending operation, and the residual stress and bend angle post-bending. The bend angles predicted by the process digital-twin were within 0.5deg and 3deg of the physical product for two different test scenarios.

28	DTCPS	Transfer learning as an enabler of the intelligent digital twin	AbstractDigital Twins have been described as beneficial in many areas, such as virtual commissioning, fault prediction or reconfiguration planning. Equipping Digital Twins with artificial intelligence functionalities can greatly expand those beneficial applications or open up altogether new areas of application, among them cross-phase industrial transfer learning. In the context of machine learning, transfer learning represents a set of approaches that enhance learning new tasks based upon previously acquired knowledge. Here, knowledge is transferred from one lifecycle phase to another in order to reduce the amount of data or time needed to train a machine learning algorithm.Looking at common challenges in developing and deploying industrial machinery with deep learning functionalities, embracing this concept would offer several advantages: Using an intelligent Digital Twin, learning algorithms can be designed, configured and tested in the design phase before the physical system exists and real data can be collected. Once real data becomes available, the algorithms must merely be fine-tuned, significantly speeding up commissioning and reducing the probability of costly modifications. Furthermore, using the Digital Twin's simulation capabilities virtually injecting rare faults in order to train an algorithm's response or using reinforcement learning, e.g. to teach a robot, become practically feasible.This article presents several cross-phase industrial transfer learning use cases utilizing intelligent Digital Twins. A real cyber physical production system consisting of an automated welding machine and an automated guided vehicle equipped with a robot arm is used to illustrate the respective benefits.

52	DTCPS	A new method for earthquake-induced damage identification in historic masonry towers combining OMA and IDA	This paper presents a novel method for rapidly addressing the earthquake-induced damage identification task in historic masonry towers. The proposed method, termed DORI, combines operational modal analysis (OMA), FE modeling, rapid surrogate modeling (SM) and non-linear Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). While OMA-based Structural Health Monitoring  methods using statistical pattern recognition are known to allow the detection of small structural damages due to earthquakes, even far-field ones of moderate intensity, the combination of SM and IDA-based methods for damage localization and quantification is here proposed. The monumental bell tower of the Basilica of San Pietro located in Perugia, Italy, is considered for the validation of the method. While being continuously monitored since 2014, the bell tower experienced the main shocks of the 2016 Central Italy seismic sequence and the on-site vibration-based monitoring system detected changes in global dynamic behavior after the earthquakes. In the paper, experimental vibration data (continuous and seismic records), FE models and surrogate models of the structure are used for post-earthquake damage localization and quantification exploiting an ideal subdivision of the structure into meaningful macroelements. Results of linear and non-linear numerical modeling (SM and IDA, respectively) are successfully combined to this aim and the continuous exchange of information between the physical reality (monitoring data) and the virtual models (FE models and surrogate models) effectively enforces the Digital Twin paradigm. The earthquake-induced damage identified by both data-driven and model-based strategies is finally confirmed by in-situ visual inspections.

63	DTCPS	AI-Powered Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems in Defence Transformation. Impact and Challenges	Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are changing business, and transforming defense and warfare. In particular, the paper addresses the challenges from the easy availability of AI resources to be applied to drones that are already an asymmetric threat, and the issues concerning theLethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS)that promise military advantages like the reduction of deployed soldiers, loss of civilians, damage of infrastructures, and the rapid support to decision-making. Autonomous systems can also help in disaster and humanitarian operations. However, the deployment of systems that are more and more autonomous from humans poses multidimensional challenges for their certification, compliance with ethics and international humanitarian law and present risks to security. Mechanisms for the mitigation of their proliferation to malicious non-state actors and ameaningful human controlshould be implemented. War gaming in a theoretical, risk-safe environment can assess the threats and impact of robotic weapons on future defense planning and operations. From the example of the lessons learned in the automotive industry, simulation can be applied to digital twin models of the AI system and the environment to train and test under unexpected and extreme conditions, unanticipated hardware and software failure situations and in complex dynamic operational contexts including interaction with civilian entities.

64	DTCPS	A Hybrid Control Architecture for an Automated Storage and Retrieval System	An automated retrieval and storage system, or ASRS, is a system that handles automatically the replenishment, picking, and delivery of products of a warehouse system. The current trend of ASRS is to develop less-rigid structures and continuous operations to improve the functionality, efficiency, and reactivity during its operation. However, the dynamic market changes and internal perturbations are characteristics that need to be handled by the ASRS control system to ensure the expected flexibility. The objective of this paper is two-fold. First, it proposes a framework of an ASRS control system, based on a hybrid control architecture that provides efficient operation during normal functioning and reactivity features in case of perturbations. Second, for validation purpose, a platform is constructed that simulates the virtual and physical level of the control system by means of a digital twin that represents the products and the resources composing the ASRS.

65	DTCPS	A digital twin emulator of a modular production system using a data-driven hybrid modeling and simulation approach	Virtual commissioning is a key technology in Industry 4.0 that can address issues faced by engineers during early design phases. The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin--a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms. The Digital Twin Emulator can support design decisions, test what-if system configurations, verify and validate the actual behavior of the complete system off-line, test realistic reactions, and provide statistics on the system's performance.

66	DTCPS	A Benchmarking Platform for Human-Machine Cooperation in Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems	The research community is producing a tremendous amount of works with the sole purpose to prepare for the next industrial revolution. In the context of the development of cyber-physical systems to production systems, a variety of technologies and architectures integrating humans and machines are studied. Results are evaluated using platforms to identify the best solutions. However, most platforms are designed to test one approach in a specific domain and the human integration remains difficult to evaluate. As the cooperation aspect between Humans and machines becomes of an increasing concern, a global benchmarking platform becomes necessary. Such a platform is specified in this paper. An illustration is detailed, based on the concept of digital twin.

67	DTCPS	Simulation of compensated tool path through virtual robot machining model	Nowadays, industrial robots could be a successful alternative to machine tools for milling of large parts with complex geometry. As it is known, poor accuracy which is most influenced by the stiffness of robot structure is recognized as a limiting factor for successful use of robots in milling tasks. Since there are different sources of error in robots, virtual manufacturing systems provide a useful means for products to be manufactured without the need of physical testing on the shop floor. This paper presents the developed virtual robot machining model, as a part of digital twin, for the simulation of a modified tool path generated by the compensation algorithm for the errors induced by cutting forces due to robot compliance. This part of digital twin includes the robot kinematic model, the Cartesian space robot compliance model, the model of cutting forces and the developed program based on off-line compensation algorithm. Development of such virtual robot machining model is important for the validation of modified tool path before the machining on a real robot. The developed virtual robot machining model is verified via several experiments, where the simulated surfaces are compared with the real machined surfaces generated by tool movement through a modified, i.e., corrected, trajectory on an available industrial robot programmed in G-code.

87	DTCPS	Design and application of digital twin system for the blade-rotor test rig	Digital twin technology is a key technology to realize cyber-physical system. Owing to the problems of low visual monitoring of the blade-rotor test rig and poor equipment monitoring capabilities, this paper proposes a framework based on the digital twin technology. The digital-twin based architecture and major function implementation have been carried out form five dimensions, i.e. Physical layer, Virtual layer, Data layer, Application layer and User layer. Three key technologies utilized to create the system including underlying equipment real-time communication, virtual space building and virtual reality interaction have been demonstrated in this paper. Based on RS-485 and other communication protocols, the data acquisition of the underlying devices have been successfully implemented, and then the real-time data reading has been achieved. Finally, the rationality of the system has been validated by taking the blade-rotor test rig as the application object, which provides a reference for the monitoring and evaluation of equipment involved in manufacturing and experiment.

92	DTCPS	A Hardware Testbed for Dynamic Data-Driven Aerospace Digital Twins	This paper presents a hardware testbed that furthers the development of a dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS). In particular, the focus of this testbed is on enabling a self-aware unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Self-awareness in this context refers to the ability of the vehicle to collect information about itself and use this information to alter the way it completes missions via on-board dynamic decision-making. Prior work has focused on developing computational methods that enable a digital twin of this vehicle, and demonstration of the resulting self-aware capability via simulation. This work presents a hardware testbed and associated experimental methodology for data collection, analysis, and demonstration of the self-aware UAV concept. The hardware testbed includes custom-built carbon fiber wings, the design of which have been validated via flight test. A sensor suite composed of wireless high frequency dynamic strain sensors has been developed and demonstrated using benchtop experiments. The proposed DDDAS architecture, which includes previously developed computational methods, has the potential to enable two-way coupling between estimation of the UAV structural state and dynamic mission replanning; capability that is critical for realizing the self-aware UAV concept.

93	DTCPS	An Edge Neural Cyber-Physical Production System: Products Monitoring Their Production Recommend Adaptations of Their Schedule	Presented is an edge neural cyber-physical production monitoring system in a German medium-sized enterprise's production process. Each product is equipped with a battery-powered, cost-efficient, not handpicked wireless LAN-microcontroller monitoring its product's production. If a microcontroller observes a significant plan-deviation, it sends a warning message to its product's agent in the planning system recommending an adaptation of the production schedule.The product's monitoring system, its agent in the planning system and its production schedule in combination form the product's digital twin. While the production schedule is passive data, the monitoring system and the agent are active routines. The system is used for retrofitting a production process in order to create transparency of the progress and to implement an adaptive scheduling system immediately reacting to deviations from the planned schedule. It is an implementation of the use case 'Auftragsgesteuerte Produktion' (order-controlled production) of Germany's Plattform Industrie 4.0 [www.plattform-i40.de].Test results prove the system's functionality in the enterprise's process.

96	DTCPS	Towards Twin-Driven Engineering: Overview of the State-of-The-Art and Research Directions	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex physical systems interacting with a considerable number of distributed computing elements for monitoring, control and management. They are currently becoming larger as Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS), since many industrial companies are transitioning their complex systems of systems to software-intensive solutions in different domains such as production or manufacturing. Following the development and dissemination of DevOps approaches in the Software Engineering world, we propose the Twin-Driven Engineering (TDE) paradigm as a way to upgrade the role of Digital Twins (DT) to become a central point in all the engineering activities on the CPSoS, from design to decommissioning. Since CPSoS can be highly heterogeneous, we rather target the support for producing and maintaining a single integrated virtual representation of the CPSoS (i.e. a System of Twins) on which it is possible to perform global reasoning, analysis and verification. However, such a new paradigm comes with several open research challenges. We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in key areas related to TDE. We identify under-investigated problems in related work and outline corresponding research directions.

99	DTCPS	The Digital Twin as a Common Knowledge Base in DevOps to Support Continuous System Evolution	There is an industry wide push for faster and more feature rich systems, also in the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, the need for applying agile development practices in the model-based design of CPS is becoming more widespread. This is no easy feat, as CPS are inherently complex, and their model-based development is less suited for agile development. Model-based development does suit the concept of digital twin, that is, design models representing a system instance in operation. In this paper we present an approach where the digital twins of system instances serve as a common-knowledge base for the entire agile development cycle of the system when performing system updates. Doing so enables interesting possibilities, such as the identification and detection of system variants, which is beneficial for the verification and validation of the system update. It also brings along challenges, as the executable physics based digital twin is generally computationally expensive. In this paper we introduce this approach by means of a small example of a swiveling pick and place robotic arm. We also elaborate on related work, and open future challenges.

103	DTCPS	Model improvement with experimental design for identifying error sources in a computational model	Optimization-based model improvement has been introduced as a strategy to enhance the prediction ability of a computational model. It involves model calibration, model validation, and model refinement. Model calibration estimates the optimal value of unknown parameters. Model validation determines the validity of a computational model, and model refinement enhances a model to improve its accuracy. In model improvement, a variety of sources of errors in the observation and prediction can interrupt the model improvement process. The error sources degrade the parameter estimation accuracy in model calibration. When a computational model turns out to be invalid because of these error sources, model refinement is required. However, since model validation cannot distinguish between parameter estimation errors and modeling errors, the existing method is difficult to refine the computational model efficiently. Thus, this study aims to develop a model improvement process that identifies the leading cause of invalidity of a prediction. In this work, an experimental design method is integrated with optimization-based model improvement to minimize the effect of estimation errors in model calibration. Through use of the proposed method, after calibration, the computational model mainly includes the effect of unrecognized modeling errors. Two case studies are provided to confirm the efficacy of the proposed method: an analytical beam study and automotive wheel rim analysis.

104	DTCPS	Interacting with Intelligent Digital Twins	This paper details the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) components of an Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) system for a semiconductor manufacturing company using gamming visual effects, 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) and sound effects. The designed digital twin (DT) system will allow users to detect any irregularities (such as equipment failures and defects) in the manufacturing processes, in a timely manner and test some changes without an actual touching of the physical components. The project aims to design an IDT system that enhances the user's interaction by visualizing big data in such a way which can be easily understood and processed. Thus, allowing the user to intervene and control the entire production processes from the virtual console. The designed IDT system will enhance the UX of the system through the use of new interaction methodologies. The user will have full control of the data flow which is flowing from a data lake through for example, a gazing, a gesturing and a voice recognition interface which will provide contextual information based upon the user's viewpoint. The current phase of the project investigates the use of Cave VR technology to improve the immersion and the interaction between the user and the virtual system. We seek to develop a virtual environment that makes the users feel they are naturally interacting in a visually-immersed environment irrespective of where they are located. By enhancing the interaction of the user with these new technologies, we will provide a better UX that would create an efficient system which reduces the overall costs of managing the plant and concretely realize the aspirations of Industry 4.0.

106	DTCPS	Industry 4.0 Visual Tools for Digital Twin System Design	This work analyses methods of digital model development and uses electronics production as an example. It focuses on the analysis of the visual tools of a digital manufacturing system design. The digital model development process is divided into a sequence of tasks, to solve which a number of models, methods and tools is proposed. These procedures can be used to perform simulation modelling, performance prediction, promising option selection, parameters optimisation of both the device itself and its manufacturing mechanisms along with other lifecycle components, without the expensive sample tests, field tests or introduction of any changes to the already established manufacturing, selling, service and other infrastructures. Digitalisation aspects are covered by creating interrelated digital models of the device and the digital manufacturing process model that take all the technical and economic aspects into account. This approach, called Digital Twin (of the actual production), underlies the modern Industry 4.0 concept that suggests the introduction of different cyber-physical systems in the manufacturing systems. The proposed method of the visual system design uses a complex of software tools to produce digital system models of an electronics manufacturing system. The resulting digital twin of the actual manufacturing is representative of both the produced device and its manufacturing process design features. And it can be used for preparation, analysis and manufacturing improvement purposes.		V. A. ShakhnovORCID:orcid.org/---,; A. E. KurnosenkoORCID:orcid.org/---,; A. A. DeminORCID:orcid.org/---&; A. I.

111	DTCPS	Digital Twin--The Simulation Aspect	The vision of theDigital Twinitself refers to a comprehensive physical and functional description of a component, product or system, which includes more or less all information which could be useful in all--the current and subsequent--lifecycle phases. In this chapter we focus on the simulation aspects of theDigital Twin. Today, modelling and simulation is a standard process in system development, e.g. to support design tasks or to validate system properties. During operation and for service first simulation-based solutions are realized for optimized operations and failure prediction. In this sense, simulation merges the physical and virtual world in all life cycle phases. Current practice already enables the users (designer, SW/HW developers, test engineers, operators, maintenance personnel, etc) to master the complexity of mechatronic systems.

113	DTCPS	HoloBoard: a Large-format Immersive Teaching Board based on pseudo HoloGraphics	In this paper, we present HoloBoard, an interactive large-format pseduo-holographic display system for lecture based classes. With its unique properties of immersive visual display and transparent screen, we designed and implemented a rich set of novel interaction techniques like immersive presentation, role-play, and lecturing behind the scene that are potentially valuable for lecturing in class. We conducted a controlled experimental study to compare a HoloBoard class with a normal class through measuring students' learning outcomes and three dimensions of engagement (i.e., behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement). We used pre-/post- knowledge tests and multimodal learning analytics to measure students' learning outcomes and learning experiences. Results indicated that the lecture-based class utilizing HoloBoard lead to slightly better learning outcomes and a significantly higher level of student engagement. Given the results, we discussed the impact of HoloBoard as an immersive media in the classroom setting and suggest several design implications for deploying HoloBoard in immersive teaching practices.	hologram;  immersive learning;  large-format display;  mixed reality;  teaching board	Gong, Jiangtao; Han, Teng; Guo, Siling; Li, Jiannan; Zha, Siyu; Zhang, Liuxin; Tian, Feng; Wang, Qianying; Rui, Yong	UIST '21: The 34th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology	https://doi.org/10.1145/3472749.3474761		441-456	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3472749.3474761,

114	DTCPS	Designing a Multi-Agent Occupant Simulation System to Support Facility Planning and Analysis for COVID-19	The COVID-19 pandemic changed our lives, forcing us to reconsider our built environment, architectural designs, and even behaviours. Multiple stakeholders, including designers, building facility managers, and policy makers, are making decisions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and make our environment safer; however, systems to effectively and interactively evaluate virus transmission in physical spaces are lacking. To help fill this gap, we propose OccSim, a system that automatically generates occupancy behaviours in a 3D model of a building and helps users analyze the potential effect of virus transmission from a large-scale and longitudinal perspective. Our participatory evaluation with four groups of stakeholders revealed that OccSim could enhance their decision making processes by identifying specific risks of virus transmission in advance, and illuminating how each risk relates to complex human-building interactions. We reflect on our design and discuss OccSim's potential implications in the domains of 'design evaluation,' 'generative design,' and 'digital twins.'	human-building interaction;  occupancy simulation;  space analysis;  space occupancy visualization;  virtual human;  virus transmission	Lee, Bokyung; Lee, Michael; Mogk, Jeremy; Goldstein, Rhys; Bibliowicz, Jacobo; Brudy, Frederik; Tessier, Alexander	DIS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference	https://doi.org/10.1145/3461778.3462030		15-30	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3461778.3462030,

We reflect on our design and discuss OccSim's potential implications in the domains of 'design evaluation,' 'generative design,' and 'digital twins.'"",

116	DTCPS	Digital Twin: Mitigating Unpredictable, Undesirable Emergent Behavior in Complex Systems	"Systems do not simply pop into existence. They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to ""normal accidents."" We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin."

117	DTCPS	Digital Twin Application for the Temperature and Steam Flow Monitoring of a Food Pasteurization Pilot Plant	In this paper, the development of a Digital Twin of a beverages pasteurization system for temperature monitoring, using NI Lab-VIEW control system toolkit, is described. A cyber-physical production system, composed of a real-time simulation tool and a controller, has been set up and tested on a pilot plant set up in a university laboratory. The paper shows how the software platform, together with the hardware, has been implemented in a traditional system, not (yet) ready for Industry 4.0 technologies, and therefore underlines the main issues occurred during its development. The Digital Twin includes a CompactRIO controller and a set of probes, connected with the controller. The aim of the Digital Twin is to monitor the machine status, with a particular attention to the temperature reached by the service water and the required steam flow. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this system, a set of experimental tests has also been carried out.

121	DTCPS	Digital and Physical Testbed for Production Logistics Operations	Digitalisation and automation of existing processes are key factors for competitive industry, but still logistics operations are often dominated by manual work. A shift towards higher degree of automation within existing infrastructure is often challenged by high cost and complex processes, thus a return-on-investment is hardly achievable within decent time. The experience has shown that it is hard to assess all restrictions and interactions between new and old components before any new equipment or infrastructure is implemented and put into operation. This paper presents and discusses if the usage of digital twins representing and simulating a physical part can support the related assessing and decision-making processes. In this context, this paper presents a production logistics test-bed includes physical devices, an IoT-infrastructure and simulation software for innovation as well as operational management purposes.

124	DTCPS	Dealing with Uncertainty in Software Architecture on the Internet-of-Things with Digital Twins	When architecting Software-intensive Systems-of-Systems (SoS) on the Internet-of-Things (IoT), architects face two sorts of uncertainties. First, they have only limited knowledge about the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed. Second, the constituent systems which will compose the SoS might not be known a priori (at design-time) or their availability (at run-time) is affected by dynamic factors, due to the openness of the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to deal with uncertainty in the design of an SoS architecture on the IoT. To tackle this challenging issue, this paper addresses the notion of uncertainty due to partial information in SoS and proposes an enhanced SoS Architecture Description language (SosADL) for expressing SoS architectures on the IoT under uncertainty. The core SosADL is extended with concurrent constraints and the concept of digital twins coupling the physical and virtual worlds. This novel approach is supported by an integrated toolset, the SosADL Studio. Validation results demonstrate its effectiveness in an SoS architecture for platooning of self-driving vehicles.

125	DTCPS	Computer Vision with Cognitive Learning to Improve the Decision-Making During the Sales Process in Physical Stores	In a world where the information is obtained faster than ever seem, new methods to process that high volume of data are being developed frequently. This is more notorious in a virtual ambient where the data is generated in a manner that is faster and easier to analyze than in the real world. This is very evident in the retail field, where virtual stores have easy access to all the advertisement a user visited and simple to obtain user profile, on the other hand physical stores are limited to basically create a register in a database when there is a purchase. In an attempt to improve the retailers experience from physical stores to manage their business this document has the objective to develop a computational tool that will analyze the people flux going in the establishment, trying to inform the retailer the amount of people and their gender to help the sales process in physical stores. To this end, computational vision methods and algorithms were raised, which after selection, theoretical conception and tool's implementation it was tested with benchmarks to operate locally and in real time by accessing the cameras installed strategically in a real scenario. Two scenarios were tested: static ambient light and dynamic light. Two tests were conducted: YOLOv2 against background subtraction-based counter; gender classification using full body features. Even though the results were not as positive as needed for commercial use, the tool demonstrated potential and space for improvements.

126	DTCPS	Creating the foundation for digital twins in the manufacturing industry: an integrated installed base management system	Services play an important role in the manufacturing industry. A shift in emphasis from selling physical products to offering product-service systems is perceived. Detailed knowledge of machines, components and subcomponents in whole plants must be provided. Installed base management contributes to this and enables services in manufacturing to maintain high machine availability and reduce downtimes. Installed base management assists in data structuring and management. By combining installed base data with sensor data, a digital twin of the installed base results. Following the action design research approach, an integrated installed base management system for manufacturing is presented and implemented in practice. An engineering and manufacturing company is involved in the research process and ensures practical relevance. Requirements are not only deduced from the literature but also identified in focus group discussions. A detailed test run with real data is performed for evaluation purpose using a demonstration machine. To enable a generalization, design principles for the development and implementation of such an integrated installed base management system are created.

131	DTCPS	Enterprise Feature Ontology for Feature-based Product Line Engineering and Operations	Feature trees have been the standard data structure for representing product diversity in feature-based systems and software product line engineering (PLE). For basic product lines of modest size or complexity, one or several modular feature trees can be sufficient for managing the and resolving the variation present across the engineering assets in the systems engineering 'V' --- from requirements, to design, through implementation, verification, validation, documentation, and more --- in the software, mechanical, and electrical disciplines. However, enterprises seeking to adopt PLE at all levels of their organization, including areas such as product marketing, portfolio planning, manufacturing, supply chain, product sales, product service and maintenance, Internet-of-Things, resource planning, and much more are finding that thousands of nonengineering users need different views and interaction scenarios with a feature diversity representation. This paper describes a feature ontology (a specification of the meaning of terms in the feature modeling realm) that is suitable for managing the feature-based product line engineering and operations in the largest and most complex product line organizations. This ontology is based on layers of abstraction that each incrementally constrain the complexity and combinatorics and targets specific roles in the organization for greater degrees of efficiency, precision, and automation across an entire business enterprise.	variation points;  software product lines;  product portfolio;  product configurator;  feature-based product line engineering;  feature profiles;  feature modeling;  enterprise feature ontology;  bill-of-features;  Product line engineering;  PLE factory	Krueger, Charles; Clements, Paul	SPLC '17: Proceedings of the 21st International Systems and Software Product Line Conference - Volume A	https://doi.org/10.1145/3106195.3106218		227-236	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3106195.3106218,

As a result of these initiatives, manufacturing firms have started to integrate a series of emerging technologies into their processes that will change the way products are designed, manufactured, and consumed. This article provides a comprehensive review of how service-oriented computing is being employed to develop the required software infrastructure for Industry 4.0 and identifies the major challenges and research opportunities that ensue. Particular attention is paid to the microservices architecture, which is increasingly recognized as offering a promising approach for developing innovative industrial applications. This literature review is based on the current state of the art on service computing for Industry 4.0 as described in a large corpus of recently published research papers, which helped us to identify and explore a series of challenges and opportunities for the development of this emerging technology frontier, with the goal of facilitating its widespread adoption.

135	DTCPS	Mixed Reality Environment for Complex Scenario Testing	Driver assistance systems are currently evaluated using standardized test procedures as defined, for example, by Euro NCAP, but which only represent a narrow, idealized spectrum of real-life situations. Test conditions hardly take into account the variability that occur in everyday traffic - adverse weather conditions such as fog, rain, snow or darkness are typically not considered, nor are the resulting changes in, e.g., the behavior of pedestrians. In an emergency braking situation, the behavior of the VRU can also be directly affected by the interaction with the vehicle. For example, a pedestrian might be alarmed by an approaching car. This could elicit a very different response in the human that cannot be simulated in the dummy motion as defined in the standard test procedure. In order to create a more versatile and interactive simulation and test environment, we have developed the Mixed Reality Test Environment MiRE. The goal of Mixed Reality Test Environment MiRE is to enable testing of a broader range of scenarios, including interaction between VRUs and vehicles. During the demo, we will demonstrate MiRE live to interested visitors and show its full potential for future driving safety tests.

In this work-in-progress we sketch our vision of this bicycle, discuss some challenges for its development, and present early results. We present a self-balancing function using reinforcement learning and current progress in the development of a virtual reality motion bicycle simulator.

138	DTCPS	Fused Twins: A Cognitive Approach to Augmented Reality Media Architecture	"Recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR), the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and Digital Twins transform the types, rates, and volume of information generated in buildings as well as the mediums through which they can be perceived by users. These advances push the standard approach of media architecture to embed screens in the built environment to its limits because screens lack the immersive capacity that newer media afford. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AR approach to media architecture that uses a Digital Twin as a platform for structuring and accessing data from various sources, including IoT and simulations. Our technical contribution to media architecture is threefold. First, we extend the possibilities of media architecture beyond embedded screens to three dimensions by presenting a Digital Twin using AR with a head-mounted display. This approach results in a shared and consistent augmented experience across large architectural spaces. Second, we use the Digital Twin to integrate and visualize real physical sensor information. Third, we make artificial occupancy simulations accessible to everyday users by presenting them within their natural context in the Digital Twin. Observing the Digital Twin in situ of the Physical Twin also has applications beyond media architecture. Fusing the two twins using AR can reduce the cognitive load of users from consuming big and complex information sources and enhance their experience. We present two use cases of the proposed Fused Twins in a university building at ETH Z\""{u}rich. In the first use case, we visualize a dense indoor sensor network (DISN) with 390 IoT sensors that collected data from March 2020 to May 2021. In the second use case, we immerse visitors in agent-based simulations to enable insights into the real and projected uses of space. This work brings forward an ambitious vision for media architecture beyond traditional flat screens, and showcases its potential through fusing state of the art simulations, sensor data integration and augmented reality, finally making the jump from fiction to reality."

139	DTCPS	The virtual twin: controlling smart factories using a spatially-correct augmented reality representation	With the advent of digitalization in industrial settings, referred to as Industry 4.0, more and more machine data is being collected and analyzed during a machine's life cycle. The availability to leverage machine data allows the concept of the Digital Twin. The more data that is collected the more statistically relevant and reliable the digital representation. This data within the Digital Twin is usually hard to access and to consume by humans. Typically, there is just a web-based user interface or basic queries available to mine the data. Therefore, we propose the concept of a Virtual Twin, which is an interactive virtual representation (virtual 3D model) of a physical object. The benefit of a Virtual Twin is that machines and equipment are arranged in the same way and at the same position in relation to each other as their real-world counterparts. The virtual 3D representation functions as an intuitive gateway to the corresponding Digital Twin. In this paper, we present the concept and implementation of the Virtual Twin and discuss potential use cases as well as areas of application.	virtual twin;  hololens;  digital twin;  augmented reality	Kritzler, Mareike; Funk, Markus; Michahelles, Florian; Rohde, Wolfgang	IoT '17: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on the Internet of Things	https://doi.org/10.1145/3131542.3140274		1-2	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3131542.3140274,

140	DTCPS	A visual programming approach based on domain ontologies for configuring industrial IoT installations	Industrial products tend to be customized by third-parties for different use cases. This is currently supported by adding external Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) to installations. As IoT software ecosystems become wide-spread, the need for such hardware will decrease. However, removing the controllers opens the challenge of configuring distributed industrial installations. This paper argues for modeling application requirements on industrial installations so that they can be evaluated automatically based on information about targeted installations. GIMLE, a visual language for modeling application requirements using expressive domain knowledge, is proposed. GIMLE enables modeling requirements on physical features of installations, which hasn't received significant attention in the related work. A study with domain experts is used to reflect on the proposed process. The scalability of the visual language is evaluated using a model for a real-world application. The support for reuse of requirements enabled us to build models that can add support for new installations without significant changes and with a slower increase in size the more components can be reused.	visual programming;  modeling;  end-user programming	Tomlein, Mat\'{u}\v{s}; Gr\o{}nb\ae{}k, Kaj	IoT '17: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on the Internet of Things	https://doi.org/10.1145/3131542.3131552		1-9	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3131542.3131552,

Using transfer learning with a pre-trained Faster R-CNN network, we are able to train a parkour training spot detector with only a few thousand street level photographs. We utilize a simple and efficient annotation scheme that only required a few days of annotation work by parkour hobbyists, and should be easily applicable in other contexts, e.g. skateboarding. The technology is tested through parkour spot exploration and visualization experiments. To inform and motivate the technology development, we also conducted an interview study about what makes an interesting parkour spot and how parkour hobbyists find spots. Our work should be valuable for researchers and practitioners of fields like urban design and exercise video games, e.g., by providing data for a location-based game akin to Pok\'{e}mon Go, but with parkour-themed gameplay and challenges.	urban design;  transfer learning;  playable cities;  parkour;  machine learning;  computer vision	"Saloheimo, Tuure; Kaos, Maximus; Fricker, Pia; H\""{a}m\""{a}l\""{a}inen, Perttu"	Academic Mindtrek '21: Proceedings of the 24th International Academic Mindtrek Conference	https://doi.org/10.1145/3464327.3464369		49-59	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3464327.3464369,

146	DTCPS	Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors as Physical Unclonable Identifiers in Anti-counterfeiting	Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors (CSRs) are made of droplets of cholesteric liquid crystals (the same material under the screen of our mobile phones) but molded in a spherical shape and hardened into a solid. CSRs have a peculiar behavior when illuminated: they reflect light and produce unique optical patterns whose full display is hardly predictable. They have been argued to behave like an optical Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), therefore finding application in anti-counterfeiting, in particular for object authentication. However, a fundamental challenge remains open: to understand what makes each optical response unique and how to extract this identifying information reliably and repeatedly. We study the problem, and we design and discuss two pivotal procedures to build authentication protocols for objects coated with CSRs. We test the quality of our procedures against large data sets of pattern images: images from CSRs are used to calculate inter- and intra-distance; simulated patterns created artificially are used to measure security in terms of false positive ratio. Our procedures successfully cluster images coming from the same CSR, distinguishing them from images of different CSRs and decoys. Our work is one of the few that has studied procedures of information extraction for materials derived from CSRs. It advances the state of the art in this area, closing the gap between the research on optical PUFs and practical applications.

151	DTCPS	Model-Driven Systems Engineering for Virtual Product Design	Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) aims to provide a systems engineering methodology that leverages modeling methods to support design, analysis, verification, and validation of systems. As such, methodologies for MBSE have to be able to integrate heterogeneous engineering models from a variety of domains, including mechanical engineering, product design, legislation, and many more. Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations. We present a method to integrate abstract system descriptions in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, which are not only the primary model for geometrical hardware descriptions but also the starting point of most process chains in the context of virtual product development. The transformations of our method are realized in a plug-in for the MagicDraw modeling environment and support to generate parameters of a parameter and constraint CAD modeling approach from a SysML model. This automates the integration of abstract system descriptions with design models to foster a coherent virtual product development.

As such, methodologies for MBSE have to be able to integrate heterogeneous engineering models from a variety of domains, including mechanical engineering, product design, legislation, and many more. Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations. We present a method to integrate abstract system descriptions in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, which are not only the primary model for geometrical hardware descriptions but also the starting point of most process chains in the context of virtual product development. The transformations of our method are realized in a plug-in for the MagicDraw modeling environment and support to generate parameters of a parameter and constraint CAD modeling approach from a SysML model. This automates the integration of abstract system descriptions with design models to foster a coherent virtual product development."",

153	DTCPS	Equilibrium Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Ride-hailing Vehicle Network	Ubiquitous mobile computing have enabled ride-hailing services to collect vast amounts of behavioral data of riders and drivers and optimize supply and demand matching in real time. While these mobility service providers have some degree of control over the market by assigning vehicles to requests, they need to deal with the uncertainty arising from self-interested driver behavior since workers are usually free to drive when they are not assigned tasks. If a driver's behavior can be accurately replicated on the digital twin, more detailed and realistic counterfactual simulations will enable decision making to improve mobility services as well as to validate urban planning. In this work, we formulate the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and proposed an algorithm to derive an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework combines value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy given expected state visitation and policy propagation to compute multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Furthermore, we developed a method to learn the driver's reward function transferable to an environment with significantly different dynamics from training data. We evaluated the robustness to changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and deterioration in data quality using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset; our approach significantly outperforms several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy. The computational time required to obtain an equilibrium policy shared by all vehicles does not depend on the number of agents, and even on the scale of real-world services, it takes only a few seconds on a single CPU.	inverse reinforcement learning;  equilibrium;  Markov games;  Counterfactual simulation	Oda, Takuma	WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021	https://doi.org/10.1145/3442381.3449935		2281-2290	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3442381.3449935,

Of course, human hands are much more sophisticated, able to form rich 3D poses capable of far more complex interactions than poking at a screen. In this paper, we describe how conventional capacitive touchscreens can be used to estimate 3D hand pose, enabling richer interaction opportunities. Importantly, our software-only approach requires no special or new sensors, either internal or external. As a proof of concept, we use an off-the-shelf Samsung Tablet flashed with a custom kernel.

157	DTCPS	Capturing Autonomy in its Multiple Facets: A Digital Twin Approach	Autonomy has been touted to be a major asset of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and its components. By intertwining non-physical and physical processes they seamlessly integrate interdependent computational and physical components. In this contribution we take a closer look on structural constellations of CPS and their components that refer to autonomy. We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively. Critical elements, such as managing private data in healthcare, can be monitored and adapted to individual needs.	autonomy;  cyber-physical systems;  digital twin;  socio-technical systems design;  subject-orientation	Heininger, Richard; Stary, Chris	SAT-CPS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3445969.3450422		3-12	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3445969.3450422,

158	DTCPS	A Data-driven System for City-wide Energy Footprinting and Apportionment	Energy footprinting has the potential to raise awareness of energy consumption and lead to energy-saving behavior. However, current methods are largely restricted to single buildings; these methods require energy and occupancy monitoring sensor deployments, which can be expensive and difficult to deploy at scale. Further, current methods for estimating energy consumption and population at scale cannot provide fine enough temporal or spatial granularity for a reasonable personal energy footprint estimate. In this work, we present a data-driven system for city-wide estimation of personal energy footprints. This system takes advantage of existing sensing infrastructure and data sources in urban cities to provide energy and population estimates at the building level, even in built environments that do not have existing or accessible energy or population data.

160	DTCPS	Multi-Agent Systems and Digital Twins for Smarter Cities	An intelligent combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and approaches to modeling and simulation is one of the most challenging endeavors for future cities, manufacturing industries, and predictive maintenance. Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.	multi-agent systems;  internet of things;  digital twins	"Clemen, Thomas; Ahmady-Moghaddam, Nima; Lenfers, Ulfia A.; Ocker, Florian; Osterholz, Daniel; Str\""{o}bele, Jonathan; Glake, Daniel"	SIGSIM-PADS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSIM Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation	https://doi.org/10.1145/3437959.3459254		45-55	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3437959.3459254,

Unfortunately, recent incidents show that MSPs themselves have become an attractive launchpad to gain access to customer networks. In this work, we argue that such incidents arise due to a violation of the least privilege principle. We revisit the MSP outsourcing problem through this least-privilege view, identify key challenges in realizing this framework, and present initial ideas toward this goal. In particular, we propose providing the MSP provider an isolated ""digital twin"" environment to resolve problems and prevent providers from directly accessing the customer production network. Changes are verified before importing them into the production network, ensuring there are no privilege violations.

163	DTCPS	Measurement Challenges for Cyber Cyber Digital Twins: Experiences from the Deployment of Facebook's WW Simulation System	A cyber cyber digital twin is a deployed software model that executes in tandem with the system it simulates, contributing to, and drawing from, the system's behaviour. This paper outlines Facebook's cyber cyber digital twin, dubbed WW, a twin of Facebook's WWW platform, built using web-enabled simulation. The paper focuses on the current research challenges and opportunities in the area of measurement. Measurement challenges lie at the heart of modern simulation. They directly impact how we use simulation outcomes for automated online and semi-automated offline decision making. Measurements also encompas how we verify and validate those outcomes. Modern simulation systems are increasingly becoming more like cyber cyber digital twins, effectively moving from manual to automated decision making, hence, these measurement challenges acquire ever greater significance.

164	DTCPS	Steps for Data Exchange between Real Environment and Virtual Simulation Environment	Recently the technological evolution resulting from the fourth industrial revolution, especially with the advancement of the internet of things and bigdata, coupled with the change in consumer behavior, are forcing companies to improve the efficiency of production systems. Now, companies must mass produce to keep costs low, but they must also be flexible and offer a wide variety of products. Thus, companies are increasingly using computational tools to improve decision making, especially with the application of simulation and digitization of production systems. However, online data collection is presenting itself as a solution to decrease the time for the development of simulation models and, thus, speed up decision making. In this way, this work shows the steps required for online data exchange between a real system and a virtual production system. For this, a prototype will be used that demonstrates these basic concepts.

165	DTCPS	D2U: Data Driven User Emulation for the Enhancement of Cyber Testing, Training, and Data Set Generation	Whether testing intrusion detection systems, conducting training exercises, or creating data sets to be used by the broader cybersecurity community, realistic user behavior is a critical component of a cyber range. Existing methods either rely on network level data or replay recorded user actions to approximate real users in a network. Our work produces generative models trained on actual user data (sequences of application usage) collected from endpoints. Once trained to the user's behavioral data, these models can generate novel sequences of actions from the same distribution as the training data. These sequences of actions are then fed to our custom software via configuration files, which replicate those behaviors on end devices. Notably, our models are platform agnostic and could generate behavior data for any emulation software package. In this paper we present our model generation process, software architecture, and an investigation of the fidelity of our models. Specifically, we consider two different representations of the behavioral sequences, on which three standard generative models for sequential data--Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model, and Random Surfer--are employed. Additionally, we examine adding a latent variable to faithfully capture time-of-day trends. Best results are observed when sampling a unique next behavior (regardless of the specific sequential model used) and the duration to take the behavior, paired with the temporal latent variable. Our software is currently deployed in a cyber range to help evaluate the efficacy of defensive cyber technologies, and we suggest additional ways that the cyber community as a whole can benefit from more realistic user behavior emulation.	data driven;  data sets;  experimental infrastructure;  user emulation	Oesch, Sean; Bridges, Robert A.; Verma, Miki; Weber, Brian; Diallo, Oumar	CSET '21: Proceedings of the 14th Cyber Security Experimentation and Test Workshop	https://doi.org/10.1145/3474718.3475718		17-26	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3474718.3475718,

166	DTCPS	RACER: Real-Time Automated Complex Event Recognition in Smart Environments	As smart environments become laden with more and more sensors, there has been a need to develop systems that could derive useful information from these sensors and make the smart environments smarter. Complex Event Processing (CEP) has emerged as a popular strategy to identify crucial events from sensor data. However, the existing CEP strategies overlook the relationship with other sensors in the spatial vicinity and understate the temporal variation of sensor data. In this paper, we develop RACER, which is an end-to-end complex event processing system that takes into consideration both the spatial location of the sensor in observation and the varying impact of temporal changes in the sensor data. Experiments performed for a duration of five months over both collected and live streaming data shows that RACER fares well compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches.	complex event processing;  real-time spatio-temporal data;  smart environments	Verma, Rohit; Brazauskas, Justas; Safronov, Vadim; Danish, Matthew; Lewis, Ian; Mortier, Richard	SIGSIM-PADS '23: Proceedings of the 2023 ACM SIGSIM Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation	https://doi.org/10.1145/3474717.3484270		634-637	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3474717.3484270,

169	DTCPS	Constructing a digital city on a web-3D platform: simultaneous and consistent generation of metadata and tile data from a multi-source raw dataset	In this study, we develop a platform that can display approximately 20 types of data via a web browser to realize a digital twin of a wider area, including a detailed reading display of block units and individual three-dimensional point cloud data (point cloud) of a city. Using actual data, we examine if the data model and visualization design correspond with the zoom level. Owing to the comparative examination of the wide-area display performance and the map representation design in a JavaScript-based open-source library, we were able to develop a platform with light architecture and an easily customizable display. Furthermore, prototyping, based on Mapbox GL JS and Deck.GL, and the display of spatiotemporal flow layers, such as background maps, point cloud data in many places, dozens of layer display types, and the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) allowed for the seamless transition from the local government to the wide-area display in the prefecture unit in approximately 10-20 s.It is recommended that this digital smart city platform should be standardized by other local governments, especially in areas where higher-order data visualization is yet to advance. To display this digital city in a lightweight environment, we consider the digital data situation of local governments in Japan. It is necessary to define the visualized design for each zoom level according to the characteristics of the data. We then arranged the display model of each zoom level for 20 types of urban infrastructure data related to the digital smart city by referring to the style schema of the tile form. Through these tasks, we organized the commonality and optimization of data models and formats.	infrastructure 3D tiles;  digital city;  Mapbox GL JS;  Deck.GL	Seto, Toshikazu; Sekimoto, Yoshihide; Asahi, Kosuke; Endo, Takahiro	ARIC '20: Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Advances in Resilient and Intelligent Cities	https://doi.org/10.1145/3423455.3430316		1-9	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3423455.3430316,

172	DTCPS	Ensuring a Robust Multimodal Conversational User Interface During Maintenance Work	It has been shown that the provision of a conversational user interface proves beneficial in many domains. But, there are still many challenges when applied in production areas, e.g. as part of a virtual assistant to support workers in knowledge-intensive maintenance work.

175	DTCPS	Digital twin: a machine learning approach to predict individual stress levels in extreme environments	Remote Health Monitoring (RHM) has the potential to increase operational safety in extreme environments. Negative stress exposure influences mission success or the short- and long-term health conditions of deployed personnel. To quantify negative stress, we introduce a washable smart textile with integrated sensors. Analyzing the transmitted sensor values, medical advisors monitor up to 72 sensor values in parallel in case of an average group size of eight people. In order to aggregate the amount of data, we propose a stress level scale that includes stress trends. To predict individual stress levels based on sensor data, environmental quantities and the individual physiological fingerprint, we train different machine learning models. To evaluate such models, we implement a data acquisition environment to label data snapshots. Therefore, we do not need to collect in-field data and expose humans to negative stress. Moreover, we can mock sensor failures and rare, but relevant, sensor value combinations that are difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Our evaluation environment identifies Random Forest Regressor from a set of 25 models to perform best to predict individual stress levels. This model performs 23.19 times better than a zero rule classifier to distinguish among nine stress levels for mission goal health condition and 10.50 times better for mission goal mission success. Finally, we present our current RHM user interface design. It addresses issues such as information overload, avatar sympathy and unnecessary navigation paths.

176	DTCPS	Kalibre: Knowledge-based Neural Surrogate Model Calibration for Data Center Digital Twins	Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on a 32-core processor, Kalibre achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.81degC and 0.75degC in calibrating two CFD models for two production data halls hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes than existing baseline approaches.

179	DTCPS	How People Distinguish Individuals from their Movements: Toward the Realization of Personalized Agents	Demands for agents that replicate the characteristics of specific individuals are increasing. Although ways to implement personality traits into the virtual agents' movement have been widely researched, ways to create aspects of individuality that can be identified as belonging to specific individuals have not. To clarify how well humans can identify individuals from short movements and what elements of movement contribute to the perception of individuality, we examined the relationship between the degree of confidence in personal identification and statics of gesture movement. In the experiment, participants were asked to compare pairs of short presentation animations and give their degree of confidence that the two animations were of the same person. The animations were created with motion data from performers and with 3D-CG characters to reduce the differences in appearances and shot angles. We calculated five expressivity parameters from the wrist movement for each gesture and compared the answers from the participants. The results showed that the participants were able to distinguish individuals doing the same action and recognize the individuals by the spatial and temporal extents of their movement, which were represented by how much space they use and how fast they moved their wrists. This study clarifies the cognitive aspects of what elements need to be reproduced to develop agents with individuality.

181	DTCPS	Wearable sensor driven Cardiac model to derive hemodynamic insights during exercise	In this paper, we propose a cardiovascular digital twin platform to simulate the effect of exercise on various cardiac parameters of medical importance.

182	DTCPS	Distributed Approaches to Supply Chain Simulation: A Review	The field of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is experiencing rapid strides in the use of Industry 4.0 technologies and the conceptualization of new supply chain configurations for online retail, sustainable and green supply chains, and the Circular Economy. Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.

183	DTCPS	Facebook's Cyber-Cyber and Cyber-Physical Digital Twins	A cyber-cyber digital twin is a simulation of a software system. By contrast, a cyber-physical digital twin is a simulation of a non-software (physical) system. Although cyber-physical digital twins have received a lot of recent attention, their cyber-cyber counterparts have been comparatively overlooked. In this paper we show how the unique properties of cyber-cyber digital twins open up exciting opportunities for research and development. Like all digital twins, the cyber-cyber digital twin is both informed by and informs the behaviour of the twin it simulates. It is therefore a software system that simulates another software system, making it conceptually truly a twin, blurring the distinction between the simulated and the simulator. Cyber-cyber digital twins can be twins of other cyber-cyber digital twins, leading to a hierarchy of twins. As we shall see, these apparently philosophical observations have practical ramifications for the design, implementation and deployment of digital twins at Facebook.

184	DTCPS	SMARTLAGOON: Innovative modelling approaches for predicting socio-environmental evolution in highly anthropized coastal lagoons	Coastal lagoons are ecosystems with significant environmental and socio-economic value. However, these natural systems are especially vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic pressures, such as intensive agriculture and extensive urbanization as a consequence of the tourist development. Despite the vulnerability and complexity of these ecosystems, there has been limited development of novel techniques which can provide real-time monitoring, analysis and management of these critical resources. Beyond being useful for policy-making procedures at multiple levels of granularity, such tools can increase local and citizen awareness of environmental impacts. This paper introduces the key concept behind the SMARTLAGOON project, which intends to develop a digital twin to build a systemic understanding of the socio-environmental inter-relationships affecting coastal lagoons and their ecosystem. Particularly, we focus on the main research activities carried out since the beginning of the project (January 1st, 2021), which are mainly based on initial mapping and reporting of the main stakeholders' needs and wishes in relation to the technological products to be developed in SMARTLAGOON. This will onset the initial development pathway, while additional stakeholder inputs during the project lifetime will help to further explore and prioritize the key developments, thus maximizing the relevance and impact of the Mar Menor's digital twin.

185	DTCPS	Research on Application of Information Model in Wind Turbine Fault Diagnosis	With the increasing proportion of wind power technology in China's energy structure, the fault diagnosis technology of generators, which is the key equipment of wind power generation, is becoming increasingly important. At present, the methods of the fault diagnosis of wind turbines are mostly based on traditional SCADA systems and big data analysis technology. The fault diagnosis process is complicated. Based on the current mature Internet technology, this paper introduces the concept of the Industrial Internet information model into the fault diagnosis of wind turbines and realizes the intelligentization of fault diagnosis of wind turbines. At the same time, the feasibility analysis of this scheme was carried out by studying the existing related cases. The results show that the information model has a stronger application prospect in the fault diagnosis of wind turbines. Compared with traditional methods, the new solution proposed in this paper makes the operation and maintenance and diagnosis of wind turbines more ideal.

187	DTCPS	Open3DGen: open-source software for reconstructing textured 3D models from RGB-D images	This paper presents the first entirely open-source and cross-platform software called Open3DGen for reconstructing photorealistic textured 3D models from RGB-D images. The proposed software pipeline consists of nine main stages: 1) RGB-D acquisition; 2) 2D feature extraction; 3) camera pose estimation; 4) point cloud generation; 5) coarse mesh reconstruction; 6) optional loop closure; 7) fine mesh reconstruction; 8) UV unwrapping; and 9) texture projection. This end-to-end scheme combines multiple state-of-the-art techniques and provides an easy-to-use software package for real-time 3D model reconstruction and offline texture mapping. The main innovation lies in various Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques that are used with additional depth data to yield high-quality 3D models in real-time and at low cost. The functionality of Open3DGen has been validated on AMD Ryzen 3900X CPU and Nvidia GTX1080 GPU. This proof-of-concept setup attains an average processing speed of 15 fps for 720p (1280x720) RGBD input without the offline backend.

189	DTCPS	Filling the Gap between Scientific Research on Artificial Intelligence and Industry 4.0 Need	"AI improves the data acquisition and analysis typical of the 4.0 paradigm, leading to the optimization of the industrial processes through fast, lightweight and well-performing algorithms. The academic research efforts on AI have followed a trend of development of complex and resource-intensive algorithms that require cloud-centric architectures while the industrial architectures for data acquisition are in most cases distributed, fragmented and resource-constrained.

190	DTCPS	When wearable technology meets computing in future networks: a road ahead	Rapid technology advancement, economic growth, and industrialization have paved the way for developing a new niche of small body-worn personal devices, gathered together under a wearable-technology title. The triggers stimulated by end-users interest have introduced the first generation of mass-consumer wearables in just the past decade. Evidently, the trailblazing ones were not designed with strict energy-consumption restrictions in mind. Thus, wearable-computing-related research remained fragmented. Advanced and sophisticated batteries and communication technologies could be already procurable on devices. Additional solutions for efficient utilization of processing power are still a white spot on the wearable technology roadmap. A-WEAR EU project aims to enhance the understanding of how the superimposition of those technologies would improve wearable devices' energy efficiency, with the research area being far from saturation.

It is important for companies and their staff to be flexible in accepting this change and to be ready to upgrade their equipment, structures and processes. In this paper, taking as a case study the Smart Retrofitting process performed applying a Design Thinking approach at a foundry in Livorno, Tuscany, we analyze the relationship between man and machine in the industrial sector and how the introduction of data collections devices, sensors and Machine Learning algorithms in production processes represents an opportunity to redesign this relationship. The solutions proposed aim to allow the plant to increase efficiency and decrease machinery fault. The main contribution of this work is to show how a XX century production machinery can be upgraded through human-centered Retrofitting focusing on specific problems to produce rapid and low-cost technical improvements, as well as the way in which the worker approaches their new or traditional tasks.

192	DTCPS	Event Prediction in the Big Data Era: A Systematic Survey	Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either our society or the nature, such as earthquakes, civil unrest, system failures, pandemics, and crimes. It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.

193	DTCPS	Model-based clinical assist system for cardiac ablation	"Cardiac Ablation is an effective treatment of arrhythmia in which physicians terminate fast heart rate by transecting abnormal electrical conduction pathways in the heart with RF energy. During the procedure, physicians diagnose the condition of the heart and locate ablation sites by analyzing electrical signals sensed by catheters inserted into the heart. Due to the limited observation of the patient's heart, there may exist multiple heart conditions that can explain historical observations, causing ambiguities in the patient's heart condition. During the procedure, physicians have to visualize and continuously update these suspected heart conditions in their mind, causing heavy mental burden on the physicians. In this paper, cardiac electrophysiology is formalized using a physiological model of the heart, such that the diagnosis problem during cardiac ablation can be formalized as parameter identification and state estimation problems with the heart model. We then propose a model-based clinical assist system which partially solves the diagnosis problem during cardiac ablation. The system enumerates suspected heart conditions by creating ""digital twins"" of the patient's heart with heart models. The heart models are used to represent and visualize suspected heart conditions, and are systematically updated and removed with new information during the ablation procedure.

195	DTCPS	Hybrid Approach for Digital Twins in the Built Environment	In recent years, several countries have created policies to enforce Zero Energy Building (ZEB) standards for new building construction. Achieving this for new buildings is feasible, but it may be difficult to transform existing buildings to ZEBs. Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment. A case study for a digital twin of a single room is also discussed. The initial comparison of cooling energy between the physical testbed and the DT model shows promising results for future development. The limitations, challenges, and future development of the approach are also addressed in the paper.	building modeling;  digital twin;  hybrid models	Lin, Yu-Wen; Tang, Tsz Ling Elaine; Spanos, Costas J.	e-Energy '21: Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Future Energy Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3447555.3466585		450-457	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3447555.3466585,

196	DTCPS	An anomaly detection framework for digital twin driven cyber-physical systems	In recent years, the digital twin has been one of the active research areas in modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Both the digital twin and its physical counterpart, called a plant, are highly intertwined such that they continuously exchange data to reveal useful information about the overall system. Such class of CPSs need to be robust to various types of disturbances, such as faulty sensors and model discrepancies, since the interplay between the physical plant's operation and digital twin's simulation may lead to undesirable or even destructive effect. To address this problem, this paper introduces a flexible anomaly detection framework for monitoring anomalous behaviours in digital twin based CPSs. In particular, our approach integrates both the digital twin and data-driven techniques that detect and classify anomalous behaviours due to modelling errors (e.g. incomplete models) and sensor and physical system's faults. The framework can be deployed to any general CPSs without the full knowledge of the digital twin's internal model. Therefore, our method is amenable to various types of digital twin implementations that enhance the traditional data-driven anomaly detection mechanism. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process model. The experimental result shows our approach is able to effectively detect and classify anomaly sources from the physical plant, sensor and digital twin, even in the situation when a certain combination of multiple anomalies occur simultaneously.	discrepancy monitoring;  digital twin;  cyber-physical system;  anomaly detection	Gao, Chuanchao; Park, Heejong; Easwaran, Arvind	ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3450267.3450533		44-54	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3450267.3450533,

Therefore, fishery farmers have started adopting smart fisheries technologies to better manage their fish farms. Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically.Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem.

198	DTCPS	Flexibility Management of Data Centers to Provide Energy Services in the Smart Grid	In this paper, we address the problem of Data Centers (DCs) energy efficiency considering their integration into the electrical and thermal grids by emphasizing the role of the DC Digital Twin model in DC flexibility management. Due to their high digitization and controllable energy systems, the DCs can act as flexible assets, being able to dynamically adapt their energy profiles and valuable energy services. We present a flexibility management solution that is using a Digital Twin model of DC systems to determine action plans for shifting energy load. DC monitored data is acquired by integration with existing DC infrastructure management (DCIM) while energy predictions are computed for DC energy demand, energy flexibility, and heat generation. The flexibility optimization plans for DC operation are determined and enforced after DC manager validation via DCIM integration. Five energy services are identified as suitable to be provided by the DC with the help of described flexibility management solution: energy trading for increasing profit, grid congestion management by decreasing DC energy demand, scheduling by increasing DC energy demand to consume as much as possible the renewable available in the local grid, power factor compensation and sell heat on demand.

In the coming years they will be introduced on a large scale in the industry and in other spheres. A wide range of digital twins will be in demand: from separate components to complex technical facilities, such as automobiles, airplanes, manufacturing lines, factories, corporations, etc. To provide their successful interaction, it is important to create digital twins on the uniform principles.

The starting point for the investigation was the observation that physiotherapists are bricoleurs--that is, practitioners who are skillful in creatively using the available materials in their environment. We conducted co-design workshops with physiotherapists that informed the development of a prototype toolkit, the ExerTiles, comprising a set of interactive tiles with control components. The toolkit was assessed by seven physiotherapists who created balance training exercises for two older adults each. Post-test interviews revealed that all the physiotherapists were highly positive toward using the ExerTiles as part of their professional work. The following five factors contributed toward the acceptance of ExerTiles by the physiotherapists: tailorability, versatile training, creativity, fun, and portability.

204	DTCPS	Multi-scale Modelling of Urban Air Pollution with Coupled Weather Forecast and Traffic Simulation on HPC Architecture	Urban air pollution is one of the global challenges to which over 3 million deaths are attributable yearly. Traffic is emitting over 40\% of several contaminants, like NO2 [10]. The directive 2008/50/EC of the European Commission prescribes the assessment air quality by accumulating exceedance of contamination concentration limits over a one-year period using measurement stations, which may be supplemented by modeling techniques to provide adequate information on spatial distribution. Computational models do predict that small scale spatial fluctuation is expected on the street level: local air flow phenomena can cluster up pollutants or carry them away far from the location of emission [2]. The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus also interacts with urban air quality. Regions in lock down have highly reduced air pollution strain due to the drop of traffic [4]. Also, correlation between the fatality rate of a previous respiratory disease, SARS 2002, and Air Pollution Index suggests that bad air quality may double fatality rate [6]. At street level pollution dispersion highly depends on the daily weather, a one-year simulation low time scale model is needed. Additionally, to resolve street-level phenomena a cell size of 1 to 4 meters are utilized in these regions that requires CFD methods to use a simulation domain of 1 to 100 million cells. Memory and computational requirements for these tasks are enormous, so HPC architecture is needed to have reasonable results within a manageable time frame. To tackle this challenge, the Urban Air Pollution (UAP) workflow is developed as a pilot of the HiDALGO project [7], which is funded by the H2020 framework of the European Union. The pilot is designed in a modular way with the mindset to be developed into a digital twin model later. Its standardized interfaces enable multiple software to be used in a specific module. At its core, a traffic simulation implemented in SUMO is coupled with a CFD simulation. Currently OpenFOAM (v1906, v1912 and v2006) and Ansys Fluent (v19.2) are supported. This presentation focuses on the OpenFOAM implementation, as it proved more feasible and scalable on most HPC architectures. The incompressible unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier- Stokes equations are solved with the PIMPLE method, Courant-number based adaptive time stepping and transient atmospheric boundary conditions. The single component NOx-type pollution is calculated independently as a scalar with transport equations along the flow field. Pollution emission is treated as a per cell volumetric source that changes in time. The initial condition is obtained from a steady state solution at the initial time with the SIMPLE method, using the identical, but stationary boundary conditions and source fields. Custom modules are developed for proper boundary condition and source term handling. The UAP workflow supports automatic 3D air flow geometry and traffic network generation from OpenStreetMap data. Ground and building information are used for geometry, road network for traffic, and further assets for visualization. The CFD 3D mesh generation is done by either an in-house octree-mesh generator, or the snappyHexMesh utility from OpenFOAM. Meteorological data for boundary conditions are acquired from ECMWF using the Polytope REST API [5] automatically for the user specified day and location. The values at the closes grid point is selected, transformed into the Euclidean coordinate system, and converted OpenFOAM readable file format. A custom OpenFOAM module ensures the proper handling of the altitude and time dependent boundary field. Background air quality data is acquired from the Copernicus AMS [3]. Results are validated against a local air quality sensor network which is under expansion for more accuracy. Traffic simulation or data can be obtained from external sources. For the pilot, a traffic sensor network of camera and loop detectors are installed in the Hungarian city of Gy\H{o}r. Sensory data is transmitted real time and is to be coupled into the simulation directly. Random traffic generation is also supported. Emission is computed by an in-house tool from traffic simulation results in SUMO data file format by applying the Copert model, interpolated to the CFD mesh and stored to an OpenFOAM readable file format. A custom OpenFOAM module is responsible for the timely read of this source term data and the proper adjustments on the equations. Calculation of the wind flow and the pollution dispersion is the most computationally heavy part of the workflow, as input file generation and traffic simulation top at 60 and 20 minutes on one node, respectively, for one day, in comparison to the minimum 2 hours for the smallest cell count CFD model. For benchmarking purposes, only the runtime of a small portion (15-60 minutes) of the scalable part of the OpenFOAM simulation is measured for the transient and 600 iterations for the steady state simulation. Primary benchmarks are issued on the local cluster PLEXI (18 node 2x6 core Intel X5650, 48GB RAM, 40Gb InfiniBand) with additional investigations on EAGLE (PSNC, Poznan, 1119 node 2x14 core Intel E5-2697v3, 64GB RAM, 56Gb InfiniBand) and the HAWK Test System (HLRS, Stuttgart, 5632 node 2x128 core AMD EPYC 7742, 256GB RAM, 200 Gb InfiniBand HDR200). Tuning OpenFOAM settings with optimized IO, multilevel decomposition and cell index renumbering improved speedup on PLEXI from 18 to 102 for the 1M cell count and from 49 to 77 on the 9M cell count model at 216 cores. On the HAWK Test System, speedups top at 133 for 1M and 401 for 9M cells, both at 2048 cores. On EAGLE, the 1M cell count model tops speedup at 104 at 448 cores. Saturating effect at one node core count suggests memory bandwidth limited calculations. Full day simulation runs were also done for areas within 5 cities (Gy\H{o}r, Madrid, Stuttgart, Herrenberg and Graz) with random traffic and different mesh sizes of ca. 0.8M and ca. 3M cells. The runtime of the full CFD module on PLEXI at 48 cores in 2.7 and 20 hours on average for the smaller and larger cell count, respectively. This puts the one-year simulation within reach for coarse meshes on PLEXI and finer meshes on the more powerful HPC architectures. Due to a high core count to memory channel ratio for AMD processors, poor single node parallel efficiency is expected on memory bandwidth limited applications, which supports our present findings, and are comparable with speedup results of other CFD software on the same hardware [9]. Node based speedup of certain OpenFOAM simulations, however, may show superlinear behavior [1]. In conclusion, the UAP workflow and the OpenFOAM implementation of the CFD module are on good track for reaching the goal of simulating one year within a manageable time frame. The few hours long simulation time for one day's pollution also makes the current version feasible for forecasting. Future work includes using proper orthogonal decomposition, POD[8], which is a model order reduction method for eventually improving calculation time drastically while sacrificing limited accuracy. We also plan testing and benchmarking GPGPU based solvers, implementing reaction for pollutants and extend validation using new air quality measuring stations.	coupled simulation;  Urban scale;  CFD;  Air pollution	Kornyei, Laszlo; Horvath, Zoltan; Ruopp, Andreas; Kovacs, Akos; Liszkai, Bence	HPCAsia '21 Companion: The International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region Companion	https://doi.org/10.1145/3440722.3440917		9-10	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3440722.3440917,

Computational models do predict that small scale spatial fluctuation is expected on the street level: local air flow phenomena can cluster up pollutants or carry them away far from the location of emission [2]. The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus also interacts with urban air quality. Regions in lock down have highly reduced air pollution strain due to the drop of traffic [4]. Also, correlation between the fatality rate of a previous respiratory disease, SARS 2002, and Air Pollution Index suggests that bad air quality may double fatality rate [6]. At street level pollution dispersion highly depends on the daily weather, a one-year simulation low time scale model is needed. Additionally, to resolve street-level phenomena a cell size of 1 to 4 meters are utilized in these regions that requires CFD methods to use a simulation domain of 1 to 100 million cells. Memory and computational requirements for these tasks are enormous, so HPC architecture is needed to have reasonable results within a manageable time frame. To tackle this challenge, the Urban Air Pollution (UAP) workflow is developed as a pilot of the HiDALGO project [7], which is funded by the H2020 framework of the European Union. The pilot is designed in a modular way with the mindset to be developed into a digital twin model later. Its standardized interfaces enable multiple software to be used in a specific module. At its core, a traffic simulation implemented in SUMO is coupled with a CFD simulation. Currently OpenFOAM (v1906, v1912 and v2006) and Ansys Fluent (v19.2) are supported. This presentation focuses on the OpenFOAM implementation, as it proved more feasible and scalable on most HPC architectures. The incompressible unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier- Stokes equations are solved with the PIMPLE method, Courant-number based adaptive time stepping and transient atmospheric boundary conditions. The single component NOx-type pollution is calculated independently as a scalar with transport equations along the flow field. Pollution emission is treated as a per cell volumetric source that changes in time. The initial condition is obtained from a steady state solution at the initial time with the SIMPLE method, using the identical, but stationary boundary conditions and source fields. Custom modules are developed for proper boundary condition and source term handling. The UAP workflow supports automatic 3D air flow geometry and traffic network generation from OpenStreetMap data. Ground and building information are used for geometry, road network for traffic, and further assets for visualization. The CFD 3D mesh generation is done by either an in-house octree-mesh generator, or the snappyHexMesh utility from OpenFOAM. Meteorological data for boundary conditions are acquired from ECMWF using the Polytope REST API [5] automatically for the user specified day and location. The values at the closes grid point is selected, transformed into the Euclidean coordinate system, and converted OpenFOAM readable file format. A custom OpenFOAM module ensures the proper handling of the altitude and time dependent boundary field. Background air quality data is acquired from the Copernicus AMS [3]. Results are validated against a local air quality sensor network which is under expansion for more accuracy. Traffic simulation or data can be obtained from external sources. For the pilot, a traffic sensor network of camera and loop detectors are installed in the Hungarian city of Gy\H{o}r. Sensory data is transmitted real time and is to be coupled into the simulation directly. Random traffic generation is also supported. Emission is computed by an in-house tool from traffic simulation results in SUMO data file format by applying the Copert model, interpolated to the CFD mesh and stored to an OpenFOAM readable file format. A custom OpenFOAM module is responsible for the timely read of this source term data and the proper adjustments on the equations. Calculation of the wind flow and the pollution dispersion is the most computationally heavy part of the workflow, as input file generation and traffic simulation top at 60 and 20 minutes on one node, respectively, for one day, in comparison to the minimum 2 hours for the smallest cell count CFD model. For benchmarking purposes, only the runtime of a small portion (15-60 minutes) of the scalable part of the OpenFOAM simulation is measured for the transient and 600 iterations for the steady state simulation. Primary benchmarks are issued on the local cluster PLEXI (18 node 2x6 core Intel X5650, 48GB RAM, 40Gb InfiniBand) with additional investigations on EAGLE (PSNC, Poznan, 1119 node 2x14 core Intel E5-2697v3, 64GB RAM, 56Gb InfiniBand) and the HAWK Test System (HLRS, Stuttgart, 5632 node 2x128 core AMD EPYC 7742, 256GB RAM, 200 Gb InfiniBand HDR200). Tuning OpenFOAM settings with optimized IO, multilevel decomposition and cell index renumbering improved speedup on PLEXI from 18 to 102 for the 1M cell count and from 49 to 77 on the 9M cell count model at 216 cores. On the HAWK Test System, speedups top at 133 for 1M and 401 for 9M cells, both at 2048 cores. On EAGLE, the 1M cell count model tops speedup at 104 at 448 cores. Saturating effect at one node core count suggests memory bandwidth limited calculations. Full day simulation runs were also done for areas within 5 cities (Gy\H{o}r, Madrid, Stuttgart, Herrenberg and Graz) with random traffic and different mesh sizes of ca. 0.8M and ca. 3M cells. The runtime of the full CFD module on PLEXI at 48 cores in 2.7 and 20 hours on average for the smaller and larger cell count, respectively. This puts the one-year simulation within reach for coarse meshes on PLEXI and finer meshes on the more powerful HPC architectures. Due to a high core count to memory channel ratio for AMD processors, poor single node parallel efficiency is expected on memory bandwidth limited applications, which supports our present findings, and are comparable with speedup results of other CFD software on the same hardware [9]. Node based speedup of certain OpenFOAM simulations, however, may show superlinear behavior [1]. In conclusion, the UAP workflow and the OpenFOAM implementation of the CFD module are on good track for reaching the goal of simulating one year within a manageable time frame. The few hours long simulation time for one day's pollution also makes the current version feasible for forecasting. Future work includes using proper orthogonal decomposition, POD[8], which is a model order reduction method for eventually improving calculation time drastically while sacrificing limited accuracy. We also plan testing and benchmarking GPGPU based solvers, implementing reaction for pollutants and extend validation using new air quality measuring stations."",

215	DTCPS	Real-time Multi-agent-based Decision-making Approach for Dynamic Machine Tool Selection Problem	With the development of information communication technology, intelligent manufacturing is one of the trends of manufacturing industry. Machine tool should be digital and intelligent, providing some manufacturing service via the Internet of Things. In order to solve the dynamic machine tool selection (DMTS), this paper proposes a novel decision-making approach based on real-time multi-agent. Firstly, the machine tool digital twin (MTDT) is introduced to provide real-time device data for evaluating machine tools. Based on MTDT, a real-time multi-agent-based mechanism (RTMAM) is designed for solving DMTS. Then based on exponential scale, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is modified for calculating the weight of evaluation index.

Machine tool should be digital and intelligent, providing some manufacturing service via the Internet of Things. In order to solve the dynamic machine tool selection (DMTS), this paper proposes a novel decision-making approach based on real-time multi-agent. Firstly, the machine tool digital twin (MTDT) is introduced to provide real-time device data for evaluating machine tools. Based on MTDT, a real-time multi-agent-based mechanism (RTMAM) is designed for solving DMTS. Then based on exponential scale, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is modified for calculating the weight of evaluation index. The evaluation model of machine tool is solved by Reference Ideal Method (RIM). Finally, the proposed decision-making approach for DMTS is tested in an aviation plant."",

216	DTCPS	TwinOps - DevOps meets model-based engineering and digital twins for the engineering of CPS	The engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) requires a large set of expertise to capture the system requirements and to derive a correct solution. Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS.In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow. TwinOps illustrates how to leverage several best practices in MBE and DevOps for the engineering Cyber-Physical systems. We illustrate our contribution using a Digital Twins case study to illustrate TwinOps benefits, combining AADL and Modelica models, and an IoT platform.

217	DTCPS	Towards a digital twin for cyber-physical production systems: a multi-paradigm modeling approach in the postal industry	This paper presents our early-stage research on a Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) approach as an initial step towards the definition of a Digital Twin (DT) for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.	multi-paradigm modeling;  digital twin;  cyber-physical production systems;  business process modeling;  agent-based modeling;  activity modeling	Niati, Asmaa; Selma, Cyrine; Tamzalit, Dalila; Bruneliere, Hugo; Mebarki, Nasser; Cardin, Olivier	MODELS '20: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.1145/3417990.3421438		1-7	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3417990.3421438,

218	DTCPS	Towards employing ABM and MAS integrated with MBSE for the lifecycle of sCPSoS	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are natural evolutions of embedded systems consisting of embedded computing devices and networks interacting with physical processes and possibly with a human. By introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0, CPSs are used in an interconnected way each of which may belong to a different stakeholder, building a complex System of Systems (SoS) called CPSoS. These systems need to employ some techniques to transform the collected data to knowledge with which the system can make better decisions. These capabilities can create smart CPSoS or sCPSoS.However, these systems are highly complex from both structural and behavioural point of views. Naturally, there is a need for multiple abstraction levels using different paradigms to model these system, called Multi-Paradigm modeling (MPM).In this paper, the challenges and opportunities of using agent technologies, including intelligent agents, Agent-based modeling and Simulation (ABM), and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) (or Agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)) in an integrated way with Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques are discussed to cover the whole lifecycle of sCPSoS, from simulation and analysis, to development, operation and monitoring.	smart cyber-physical system of systems;  multi-paradigm modeling;  multi-agent systems;  model-based system engineering;  agent-oriented software engineering;  agent-based modeling	Challenger, Moharram; Vangheluwe, Hans	MODELS '20: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.1145/3417990.3421439		1-7	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3417990.3421439,

221	DTCPS	Integrating digital twin security simulations in the security operations center	While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.	digital twin;  security framework;  security information and event management;  security operations center	"Dietz, Marietheres; Vielberth, Manfred; Pernul, G\""{u}nther"	ARES '20: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	https://doi.org/10.1145/3407023.3407039		1-9	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3407023.3407039,

Besides, they conclude that integrating the lean approach and industry 4.0 leads to a greater cost reduction than implementing only one of them. The current paper summarizes and proposes a conceptual framework that can guide the implementation of the integration of lean manufacturing and industry 4.0."",

225	DTCPS	Corsican Twin: Authoring In Situ Augmented Reality Visualisations in Virtual Reality	We introduce Corsican Twin, a tool for authoring augmented reality data visualisations in virtual reality using digital twins. The system provides users with the contextual information necessary to design embedded and situated data visualisations in a safe and convenient remote setting. We created system via a co-design process which involved people with little or no programming experience. Using the system, we illustrate three potential use cases for situated visualizations in the context of building maintenance, including: (1) on-site equipment debugging and diagnosis; (2) remote incident playback; and (3) operations simulations for future buildings. From feedback gathered during formative evaluations of our prototype tool with domain experts, we discuss implications, opportunities, and challenges for future in situ visualisation design tools.

239	DTCPS	Evaluating Cascading Impact of Attacks on Resilience of Industrial Control Systems: A Design-Centric Modeling Approach	A design-centric modeling approach was proposed to model the behaviour of the physical processes controlled by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and study the cascading impact of data-oriented attacks. A threat model was used as input to guide the construction of the CPS model where control components which are within the adversary's intent and capabilities are extracted. The relevant control components are subsequently modeled together with their control dependencies and operational design specifications. The approach was demonstrated and validated on a water treatment testbed. Attacks were simulated on the testbed model where its resilience to attacks was evaluated using proposed metrics such as Impact Ratio and Time-to-Critical-State. From the analysis of the attacks, design strengths and weaknesses were identified and design improvements were recommended to increase the testbed's resilience to attacks.	security evaluation;  resilience engineering;  dynamical systems modeling;  cyber-physical systems security;  cascading impact of attacks	Hau, Zhongyuan; Castellanos, John Henry; Zhou, Jianying	CPSS '20: Proceedings of the 6th ACM on Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop	https://doi.org/10.1145/3384941.3409587		42-53	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3384941.3409587,

Then, it proposes a Virtual Reality (VR) tool to configure augmentations in this captured environment. This tool includes a feature to simulate AR devices to help anticipate the application's rendering on real devices.

Further, current methods for estimating energy consumption and population cannot provide fine enough temporal or spatial granularity for a reasonable personal energy footprint estimate.

243	DTCPS	AC-ROS: assurance case driven adaptation for the robot operating system	Cyber-physical systems that implement self-adaptive behavior, such as autonomous robots, need to ensure that requirements remain satisfied across run-time adaptations. The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.	self-adaptive systems;  robot operating system;  goal structuring notation;  digital twin;  cyber-physical systems;  assurance case	Cheng, Betty H.

246	DTCPS	Towards creation of a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems	With progressing digitalization and the trend towards autonomous computing, systems tend to form digital ecosystems, where each autonomous system aims at achieving its own goals.Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that.In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem.	automotive smart ecosystem;  collaborative embedded systems;  digital ecosystems;  reference architecture;  smart ecosystems;  smart grid;  software ecosystems	Cioroaica, Emilia; Chren, Stanislav; Buhnova, Barbora; Kuhn, Thomas; Dimitrov, Dimitar	ECSA '19: Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Software Architecture - Volume 2	https://doi.org/10.1145/3344948.3344973		273-276	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3344948.3344973,

247	DTCPS	Scaffolding RAMI4.0-Exploration as Design Support	"Developing Industry 4.0 applications is a complex endeavor, as it requires adjusting several relevant perspectives and items throughout design. RAMI4.0 has been introduced to facilitate Industry 4.0 developments. It puts items from three different development dimensions in mutual context. Some items are standardized due to existing technical standards, business-oriented ones depend on the development case at hand. Case-sensitive adjustment includes resolving inconsistencies and overcoming coherence deficits. We propose scaffolding to structure and thus, facilitate design of Industry 4.0 applications based on RAMI4.0.

RAMI4.0 has been introduced to facilitate Industry 4.0 developments. It puts items from three different development dimensions in mutual context. Some items are standardized due to existing technical standards, business-oriented ones depend on the development case at hand. Case-sensitive adjustment includes resolving inconsistencies and overcoming coherence deficits. We propose scaffolding to structure and thus, facilitate design of Industry 4.0 applications based on RAMI4.0.

248	DTCPS	Promoting trust in interoperability of systems-of-systems	The ability of constituent systems to collaborate effectively in a System-of-System (SoS) depends on the extent of interoperability achieved among them. However, communication among constituents relies on common agreements made by intermediaries in many levels of interoperability, increasing the cost and barriers of collaboration. In this scenario, this work presents a Trust Interoperability Blockchain Architecture (TIBA) to enable trust in the interoperability of SoS. TIBA will be evaluated though simulations in a large company in the context of Industry 4.0, considering the Product as a Service (PaaS) business model.

250	DTCPS	Remote Guidance for Machine Maintenance Supported by Physical LEDs and Virtual Reality	Machines that are used in industry often require dedicated technicians to fix them in case of defects. This involves travel expenses and certain amount of time, both of which may be significantly reduced by installing small extensions on a machine as we describe in this paper. The goal is that an authorized local worker, guided by a remote expert, can fix the problem on the real machine himself. Our approach is to equip a machine with multiple inexpensive LEDs (light-emitting diodes) and a simple micro controller, which is connected to the internet, to remotely light up certain LEDs, that are close to machine parts of interest. The blinking of an LED can be induced on a virtual 3D model (digital twin) of the machine by a remote expert using a virtual reality application to draw the local worker's attention to certain areas. We conducted an initial user study on this concept with 36 participants and found significantly shorter completion times and less errors for our approach compared to only voice guidance with no visual LED feedback.	virtual reality;  remote machine maintenance;  light emitting diodes;  LED;  Industry 4.0;  Collaboration	"Ladwig, Philipp; Dewitz, Bastian; Preu, Hendrik; S\""{a}ger, Mitja"	MuC '19: Proceedings of Mensch und Computer 2019	https://doi.org/10.1145/3340764.3340780		255-262	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3340764.3340780,

In its various forms, it has the potential to disrupt most aspects of human life. Yet, the discourse around AI has long been by experts and for experts. In this paper, we argue for a participatory approach towards designing human-AI interactions.

We then provide insights into our findings and share our lessons learned regarding our workshop topic - AI and Space - our process, and our research. We learned that involving non-experts in complex technical discourses - such as AI - through the structural rigour of design methodology is a viable approach.

252	DTCPS	Classification of Indoor Point Clouds Using Multiviews	We present an approach for classifying 3D point clouds of indoor environments using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image analysis for entropy-selected 3D views. Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects. We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications.

256	DTCPS	A service-oriented approach for classifying 3D points clouds by example of office furniture classification	The rapid digitalization of the Facility Management (FM) sector has increased the demand for mobile, interactive analytics approaches concerning the operational state of a building. These approaches provide the key to increasing stakeholder engagement associated with Operation and Maintenance (O&M) procedures of living and working areas, buildings, and other built environment spaces. We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology.	3D point clouds;  BIM;  indoor models;  machine-learning;  service-oriented	"Stojanovic, Vladeta; Trapp, Matthias; Richter, Rico; D\""{o}llner, J\""{u}rgen"	Web3D '18: Proceedings of the 23rd International ACM Conference on 3D Web Technology	https://doi.org/10.1145/3208806.3208810		1-9	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3208806.3208810,

These approaches provide the key to increasing stakeholder engagement associated with Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) procedures of living and working areas, buildings, and other built environment spaces. We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology."",

258	DTCPS	Optimizing carbon tax for decentralized electricity markets using an agent-based model	Averting the effects of anthropogenic climate change requires a transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon technology. A way to achieve this is to decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further efforts must be made in other fields such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a low-carbon alternative. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an efficient way to aid in this transition.In this paper, we demonstrate how to to find optimal carbon tax policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a range of carbon taxes to suit differing objectives.Our results show that we are able to minimize electricity cost to below PS10/MWh as well as carbon intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy, we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above PS81/tCO2 for every year. The mean carbon tax strategy was PS240/tCO2.	policy;  optimization;  genetic algorithm;  electricity market model;  digital twin;  climate change;  carbon tax;  agent-based models;  Energy markets	Kell, Alexander J.

260	DTCPS	Adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in IoT	As Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the next logical stage of the Internet, it has become imperative to understand the vulnerabilities of the IoT systems when supporting diverse applications. Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83\% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.	wireless security;  machine learning;  internet of things;  data fusion;  adversarial machine learning	Luo, Zhengping; Zhao, Shangqing; Lu, Zhuo; Sagduyu, Yalin E.; Xu, Jie	WiseML '20: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Wireless Security and Machine Learning	https://doi.org/10.1145/3395352.3402619		13-18	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3395352.3402619,

261	DTCPS	Systematization of Digital Twins: Ontology and Conceptual Framework	The development and progress in information and communication technologies will transform traditional products into smart products and allow to offer novel smart services [1]. Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) <<Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?>>, b) <<What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?>> and c) <<How do these different specifications relate to each other?>> The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders. The holistic view on the data resource dimension further allows to easily deduct the needed data for certain applications or deduct possible applications from already available data.	systematization;  ontology;  conceptual framework;  Digital Twin	Barth, Linard; Ehrat, Matthias; Fuchs, Rainer; Haarmann, Jens	ICISS '20: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3388176.3388209		13-23	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3388176.3388209,

264	DTCPS	On the Engineering of IoT-Intensive Digital Twin Software Systems	Digital Twins (DT) are software systems representing different aspects of a physical or conceptual counterpart---the real twin, which is instrumented with several sensors or computing devices that generate, consume and transfer data to its DT with different purposes. In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.

In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns."",

266	DTCPS	Expecting the unexpected: developing autonomous-system design principles for reacting to unpredicted events and conditions	When developing autonomous systems, engineers and other stakeholders make great efforts to prepare the system for all foreseeable circumstances. However, such systems are still bound to encounter situations that were not considered at design time. For reasons like safety, cost, or ethics it is often highly desired that these new cases be handled correctly upon first encounter. In this paper, we first justify our position that there will always exist unpredicted events and conditions, driven by, e.g., new inventions in the real world, the diversity of world-wide system deployments and uses, and the possibility that multiple events that were unforeseen at design time (or overlooked, or knowingly abandoned following cost-benefit-risk calculations) will not only occur, but will occur together. We then argue that despite the unpredictability, handling such situations is indeed possible. Hence, we offer and exemplify design principles, which, when applied in advance, can improve the system's ability to deal with unpredicted situations. We conclude with a discussion of how this work and a much-needed thorough study of the unexpected can contribute toward a foundation of engineering principles for developing trustworthy next-generation autonomous systems.	unpredictable circumstances;  unexpected events;  trustworthiness;  systems engineering;  software engineering;  robustness;  autonomous systems	Marron, Assaf; Limonad, Lior; Pollack, Sarah; Harel, David	SEAMS '20: Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM 15th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3387939.3391607		167-173	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3387939.3391607,

267	DTCPS	Cloud-Based Battery Digital Twin Middleware Using Model-Based Development	Following the trends of electrification, the energy storage of vehicles is gaining importance as the most expensive part of an electric car. Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.

273	DTCPS	Towards a Generalized System for Generative Engineering	Product design based on mechanical performance requirements and with given boundary conditions is a frequent and demanding engineering problem. In most cases, effectiveness of the design is limited to expertise of the respective designer, which also results in inefficient and incomplete exploration of the product's design space. With a large amount of data available and recent advancements in hardware technology, data-driven methods have become an increasingly common strategy for problems that are difficult to formulate or expensive to solve by creating a physical model, but such methods often lack the application perspective; they are not yet widely applied especially in engineering product development. Generative design (here, more precisely generative engineering) is one such technique which has recently gained importance. Although many preliminary studies demonstrate plausible results from data-driven generative design approaches, a closeloop-3D-generative-design-pipeline that achieves full automation and optimization of the design with respect to the product's functional requirements is still in its nascent stage. This paper proposes a generalized hybrid framework comprised of both data-based and physics-based methods to achieve this objective, as represented by the teaser figure 1. An overview of various possibilities for individual modules of the framework is also discussed.

The two main features of such systems are: (1) They can automatically model the working environment and relay that information to the operator in virtual reality (VR).

280	DTCPS	An AI Driven Real-time 3-D Representation of an Off-shore WT for Fault Diagnosis and Monitoring	In recent years, digital twin (DT) has been an efficient and reliable representation tool for Industry 4.0 in general and fault diagnosis and monitoring, especially in machinery consisting of several components working in tandem that introduce a large amount of data to be processed. Having a cloud-based and platform-independent system that can interpret Big Data in real-time and represent the processed information in a user-friendly manner offers the opportunity not only for improving fault diagnosis and troubleshooting automation, but also offering a better representation of data for operators, technicians and engineers. This not only decreases the repair costs by enabling constant components' state of health awareness, but also increases the efficacy of the apparatus by lowering the downtimes due to faults and issues.In this paper (WindTwin), we propose a real-time, interactive and dynamic 3-D neural-network model that provides important information of a small-scale wind turbine (WT) machinery setup including the state of health of different components (bearings, shafts) based on monitoring sensors (vibrations and temperature) and operations conditions (rotation speed). The system features real-time data processing of six sensors with eight channels including two single axis-accelerometer, one tri-axial accelerometer, one acoustics (microphone), one temperature and one light sensor (for rotational speed) with sampling data collection rate of 51.2 kHz achieved through an edge developed machine learning algorithm based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm using single hidden-layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) and gradient-based backpropagation (BP) training algorithm. The system also provides platform-independent (desktop and mobile companion app) user interfaces thanks to its cloud-based data processing integration. The prototype system proved to have on average 83.33 \% accuracy for the vibration-based condition monitoring model across the three different rotation speed of 15Hz, 9Hz and 12Hz with 1 second latency for different fault conditions to be reflected on the DT counterpart.	artificial intelligence;  big data;  cloud-computing;  condition monitoring;  digital twin;  digitization;  machine learning	Amini, Amin; Kanfound, Jamil; Gan, Tat-Hean	ICAAI '19: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Advances in Artificial Intelligence	https://doi.org/10.1145/3369114.3369141		162-165	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3369114.3369141,

281	DTCPS	Interoperable Digital Twins in IIoT Systems by Transformation of Information Models: A Case Study with Asset Administration Shell	By providing a consolidated access point to information of devices and systems, digital twins enable new, data-intensive use cases for the industrial internet of things (IIoT), like predictive plant and product design. However, the lack of interoperability between the digital twins of different companies hinders use cases that require information exchange between different organizations. Achieving interoperability among digital twins requires transforming the included information to other formats. In this paper, we present requirements and a solution to enable interoperable digital twins by transforming their information models in a flexible way. We illustrate how we applied our solution to a real-world application example in an industrial context by transforming ABB Ability(tm) digital twins to the Asset Administration Shell format. We show that our customizable transformation system paves the way for on demand interoperability and thereby enables advanced use cases in the IIoT.

In contrast to industrial robots, the development of service robots comes with severe software engineering challenges, since they require high levels of robustness and autonomy to operate in highly heterogeneous environments. As a domain with critical safety implications, service robotics faces a need for sound software development practices. In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study to assess the state of the art and practice of robotics software engineering.

283	DTCPS	Model-driven digital twin construction: synthesizing the integration of cyber-physical systems with their information systems	Digital twins emerge in many disciplines to support engineering, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing cyber-physical systems, such as airplanes, cars, factories, medical devices, or ships. There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.	software architecture;  model-driven software engineering;  information systems;  digital twins;  cyber-physical systems	"Kirchhof, J\""{o}rg Christian; Michael, Judith; Rumpe, Bernhard; Varga, Simon; Wortmann, Andreas"	MODELS '20: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/3365438.3410941		90-101	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3365438.3410941,

284	DTCPS	Potential Demand Reduction from Buildings in a Simulated Utility	The availability of large-area sensing, scalable algorithms, and high-performance computing has enabled the possibility of urban-scale building energy modeling using new methods not limited to the scalability of manual building energy model creation or retrieval of county-by-county tax assessor's data. Automatic Building detection and Energy Model creation (AutoBEM) has created 178,368 building energy models for the Electric Power Board (EPB) of Chattanooga, TN, and compared simulation performance to 15-minute data from each building. These models leverage several data sources (e.g. imagery, GIS, utility), software tools to extract building properties (e.g. footprint, height, fa\c{c}ade type, window-to-wall ratio, occupancy, building type), simulate at scale on two of the world's #1 fastest supercomputers, and provide web-based visual analytics.Grid-interactive efficient buildings offer the potential to reduce utility and rate-payer energy costs during each calendar month's hour of critical generation -- when the least efficient, most costly, and often dirtiest generation assets must be brought online.

This is analyzed under a couple scenarios leveraging buildings as thermal batteries via pre-conditioning to coast through peak hours.

285	DTCPS	A scheme for anomalous RFID trajectory detection based on improved clustering algorithm under digital-twin-driven	Anomaly analysis of trajectories is one of the means to maintain indoor safety. Effective track anomaly detection should be based on the current road network structure. However, the indoor environment usually contains many obstacles flexible to move. The changes in the positions of obstacles frequently cause the changes of the road network structure. When the road network changes, it takes time and effort to manually redraw the road network and simultaneously losses the guarantee of real-time performance. At the same time, manual drawing is forbidden in some confidential places. In our paper, the scheme of RFID track anomaly detection combined with digital-twin technology is proposed to provide a real-time actual road network for anomaly analysis. The accurate mapping and virtual simulation functions of digital-twin technology are used to achieve the dynamic real-time rendering and the maintenance of the indoor road network structure. We also improve a clustering algorithm to make it suitable for indoor RFID track clustering. In our paper, deviation thresholds and digital-twin model are used to detect anomalies. The trajectory is judged to be abnormal when it appears in the restricted areas or exceeds the deviation thresholds in any terms of position, velocity, or direction. We use an improved scan-line algorithm and F1-scores to determine the threshold values.

286	DTCPS	Entangled Ethnography: Towards a collective future understanding	In this work, we develop a vision for entangled ethnography, where constellations of people, artefacts, algorithms and data come together to collectively make sense of the relations between people and objects. This is grounded in New Materialism's picture of a world understood through entanglement, through resonant constellations, through a multiplicity of unique individual viewpoints and their relationships. These perspectives are especially relevant for design ethnography, in particular for research around smart connected products, which collect data about their environment, the networks they are a part of, and the ways they are used. However, we are concerned about the current trend of many connected systems towards surveillance capitalism, as data is colonised, machinations are hidden, and a narrow definition of value is extracted. There is a key tension that while design, particularly of networked objects, attempts to go beyond human centeredness, the infrastructures that support it are moving towards a less than human perspective in their race to accumulate and dispossess. Our work tries to imagine the situations where participants in networked systems are richly engaged, rather than exploited. We hope for a future where human agency is central to a respectful and acceptable collaborative development of understanding.

    abstract = ""In this work, we develop a vision for entangled ethnography, where constellations of people, artefacts, algorithms and data come together to collectively make sense of the relations between people and objects. This is grounded in New Materialism's picture of a world understood through entanglement, through resonant constellations, through a multiplicity of unique individual viewpoints and their relationships. These perspectives are especially relevant for design ethnography, in particular for research around smart connected products, which collect data about their environment, the networks they are a part of, and the ways they are used. However, we are concerned about the current trend of many connected systems towards surveillance capitalism, as data is colonised, machinations are hidden, and a narrow definition of value is extracted. There is a key tension that while design, particularly of networked objects, attempts to go beyond human centeredness, the infrastructures that support it are moving towards a less than human perspective in their race to accumulate and dispossess. Our work tries to imagine the situations where participants in networked systems are richly engaged, rather than exploited. We hope for a future where human agency is central to a respectful and acceptable collaborative development of understanding."",

We want to overcome logistical problems of real laboratories by creating a precise digital twin of a RFID-Measuring-Chamber. Students will be able to perform different kinds of experiments directly in virtual reality. To diminish the disadvantage of a pure virtual experience, a process log of the experiment is created which gets carried out asynchronously by a robotic arm. The students receive data and a webcam recording of the real world experiment as feedback.

289	DTCPS	Exploiting Social Media to enhance Clinical Decision Support	Social media are increasingly used to collect data and report on the personal health status, on health issues, symptoms and experiences with treatments. The health data that is, thus, becoming available represents a valuable source for continuous health monitoring and prevention, and clinical decision making. Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them accurately. Social media data can be used to understand, in near real time, human life dynamics worldwide. These massive quantities of data could support in a wide range of medical and healthcare applications, including among others clinical trials and decision support. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) can greatly help in identifying diseases and methods of treatment. In this paper we propose a CDS framework that can integrate heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as laboratory test results, basic information of patients, health records and social media data. Using the electronic health medical data so collected, innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches are employed to implement a set of services to recommend a list of diseases and thus assist physicians in diagnosing or treating their patients' health issues more efficiently.

The question of what will the cities of the future look like is at the heart of urban studies. In parallel, a similar question is posed by (trans)humanists about the future of humanity and its possible technological enhancements. However, (trans)humanity and future cities are defined in a bi-directional dependency. Therefore, we have to answer the questions of future humans and cities simultaneously.

304	DTCPS	Drive by maintenance: towards adaptive work environments with improved industrial HCI	Although automation is the backbone of the modern industrial complex, humans remain the indispensable shepherds of the machine park. One operator may be responsible for several machines that need to run continuously. Unfortunately, the complexity of the machines and processes increased faster than the improvement in the corresponding interaction technologies. We propose a multi-modal adaptive human computer interface system for the modern industry that relies on position, activity and other relevant contextual information, in order to provide a more flexible interaction in industrial scenarios. Information about the machine, is transmitted to the worker using a vibrotactile display on his wrist whenever the line of sight is broken. The context in which the user and the machine currently reside in, are determined by software artefacts (Apps). We leverage modern software concepts and an App based eco-system platform on the manufacturing shop floor to organize the software systems described in this paper. We evaluate transmitting arbitrary information via vibrotactile displays and come to the conclusion that such a system is feasible in industrial settings and may be beneficial as it has a very low distraction rate.	hybrid software architectures;  haptic interfaces;  directional cues;  deployment and usage;  dashboards;  control room	"Miclaus, Andrei; Pescara, Erik; M\""{a}dche, Alexander; Beigl, Michael"	PETRA '19: Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments	https://doi.org/10.1145/3316782.3322751		382-388	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3316782.3322751,

307	DTCPS	A Hierarchical Digital Twin Model Framework for Dynamic Cyber-Physical System Design	Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a new trend in the complex system related research works, where network connectivity enhances computing power and systemic behavior emerges through the competition, interaction, collaboration and integration among individual interweaving, which consists of real-time monitoring, data management, physical feedback control. From this perspective, CPS is a dynamic entity with rich functions. However, designers may encounter a difficult situation, in which subsequent dynamic changes of the system are discussed and appropriate functionalities are added in the early design phase. Since the digital twin is the digital duplicate of the physical entity, it can dynamically evolve following the product life cycle. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical digital twin model framework for CPS design. In the light of digital twin concept, the hierarchical high-level models facilitate storage of information from the entire product life cycle. Finally, an industrial robot application is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the model framework.

311	DTCPS	QUILT: quality inference from living digital twins in IoT-enabled manufacturing systems	A Digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09\% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors.	smart manufacturing;  machine learning;  internet-of-things;  digital twin	Chhetri, Sujit Rokka; Faezi, Sina; Canedo, Arquimedes; Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah Al	IoTDI '19: Proceedings of the International Conference on Internet of Things Design and Implementation	https://doi.org/10.1145/3302505.3310085		237-248	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3302505.3310085,

314	DTCPS	The internet of things in undergraduate computer and information science education: exploring curricula and pedagogy	As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues its expansion into homes, businesses, government, and industries, the impact for computer science educators is amplified. In 2017, the ITiCSE IoT working group identified relevant content, tools for teaching, and four IoT course types. The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas.

In 2017, the ITiCSE IoT working group identified relevant content, tools for teaching, and four IoT course types. The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT? We found very little scholarship describing actual teaching practices, but our interviewees described their approaches and challenges in teaching.

WoT uses a formal interface description called Thing Description (TD) which describes the offerings of Things to allow the interaction in between Things. Although Things undergo changes with regard to their physical and/or software components and specifications during their lifetime, the WoT TD is currently inteded to be of a static nature. This remains contradictory with the dynamic evolution of Things along their lifecycle.

317	DTCPS	Utilizing building information models as operating systems for smart homes	"The prevalence of IoT enabled devices in the home has manifested in buildings as voice and gesture enabled devices that enable functions such as optimizing energy usage and controlling electrical fixtures. However, most of these are fundamentally dissociated from the spatial nature of buildings as they exist in isolation from the building system and other smart devices in the same space. This situation results in user interaction experiences that are convoluted and non-intuitive, negatively affecting their adoption. Meanwhile, Building Information Models, while used extensively in a building's design and construction phases, remains underutilized in its operation phase. This paper proposes BIM as an ""operating system"" for smart homes to serve as the foundational platform for smart device applications. Much like the analogous operating system for computers, BIM serves to provide IoT enabled devices access to information and control over various components of the built environment. It is expected that this smart home architecture would enable seamless integration of smart home functionality across devices and buildings to provide residents with contextualized information for optimized security, comfort, and efficiency.

319	DTCPS	Towards an open-standards based framework for achieving condition-based predictive maintenance	The advent of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology has significantly optimized the industrial operations management by connecting industrial assets with information systems and, hence, with business processes. The IIoT forms the backbone for materializing the Industry 4.0 initiative. Actionable insights obtained from industrial analytics are one of the pivotal means for achieving intelligent operations and maintenance. Intelligence refers to making optimal decisions for both automated and human-in-the-loop decision making. Condition-based predictive maintenance (CBPdM), also known as Maintenance 4.0, is among the major focus points of the Industry 4.0 and IIoT. In this paper, we discuss the existing standards related to condition-based maintenance and the potential of the Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE), a MIMOSA led initiative, as a framework which extends previous open standards for achieving CBPdM. We illustrate how the framework addresses the requirements of Industry 4.0 and CBPdM.

325	DTCPS	Early Take-Over Preparation in Stereoscopic 3D	Situation awareness in highly automated vehicles can help the driver to get back in the loop during a take-over request (TOR). We propose to present the driver a detailed digital representation of situations causing a TOR via a scaled down digital twin of the highway inside the car. The digital twin virtualizes real time traffic information and is displayed before the actual TOR. In the car cockpit an augmented reality headset or a Stereoscopic 3D (S3D) interface can realize the augmentation. As today's hardware has technical limitations, we build an HMD based mock-up. We conducted a user study (N=20) to assess the driver behavior during a TOR. We found that workload decreases and steering performance raise significantly with the proposed system. We argue that the augmentation of the surrounding world in the car helps to improve performance during TOR due to better awareness of the upcoming situation.

A main point of interest is how these components are built and interconnected, i.e. the system's architecture, and how it might be improved to increase reliability and security.Aims: Unfortunately, there is no review available describing and identifying recent research status and progress for such architectures.

Next, forward and backwards snowballing was performed to integrate the results, giving a final population of 213 papers. The output of this study is firstly a categorization and plot of architectural styles. Secondly, the categorization is extended to include security concerns.Results: In general, there is a tendency in proposing solutions in the fields of system and software architecture while other areas are visibly under-researched.

327	DTCPS	Understanding the Modeling of Computer Network Delays using Neural Networks	Recent trends in networking are proposing the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the control and operation of the network. In this context, ML can be used as a computer network modeling technique to build models that estimate the network performance. Indeed, network modeling is a central technique to many networking functions, for instance in the field of optimization, in which the model is used to search a configuration that satisfies the target policy. In this paper, we aim to provide an answer to the following question: Can neural networks accurately model the delay of a computer network as a function of the input traffic? For this, we assume the network as a black-box that has as input a traffic matrix and as output delays. Then we train different neural networks models and evaluate its accuracy under different fundamental network characteristics: topology, size, traffic intensity and routing. With this, we aim to have a better understanding of computer network modeling with neural nets and ultimately provide practical guidelines on how such models need to be trained.

328	DTCPS	Self-Generation of Access Control Policies	Access control for information has primarily focused on access statically granted to subjects by administrators usually in the context of a specific system. Even if mechanisms are available for access revocation, revocations must still be executed manually by an administrator. However, as physical devices become increasingly embedded and interconnected, access control needs to become an integral part of the resource being protected and be generated dynamically by resources depending on the context in which the resource is being used. In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed. We discuss some approaches for generating such access control policies that may address the requirements of the scenarios.

329	DTCPS	Sensorclone: a framework for harnessing smart devices with virtual sensors	IoT services hosted by low-power devices rely on the cloud infrastructure to propagate their ubiquitous presence over the Internet. A critical challenge for IoT systems is to ensure continuous provisioning of IoT services by overcoming network breakdowns, hardware failures, and energy constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose a cloud-based framework namely SensorClone, which relies on virtual devices to improve IoT resilience. A virtual device is the digital counterpart of a physical device that has learned to emulate its operations from sample data collected from the physical one. SensorClone exploits the collected data of low-power devices to create virtual devices in the cloud. SensorClone then can opportunistically migrate virtual devices from the cloud into other devices, potentially underutilized, with higher capabilities and closer to the edge of the network, e.g., smart devices. Through a real deployment of our SensorClone in the wild, we identify that virtual devices can be used for two purposes, 1) to reduce the energy consumption of physical devices by duty cycling their service provisioning between the physical device and the virtual representation hosted in the cloud, and 2) to scale IoT services at the edge of the network by harnessing temporal periods of underutilization of smart devices. To evaluate our framework, we present a use case of a virtual sensor created from an IoT service of temperature. From our results, we verify that it is possible to achieve unlimited availability up to 90\% and substantial power efficiency under acceptable levels of quality of service. Our work makes contributions towards improving IoT scalability and resilience by using virtual devices.	cloud computing;  edge computing;  internet of things;  opportunistic migration;  resilience;  virtual sensor	Flores, Huber; Hui, Pan; Tarkoma, Sasu; Li, Yong; Anagnostopoulos, Theodoros; Kostakos, Vassilis; Luo, Chu; Su, Xiang	MMSys '18: Proceedings of the 9th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference	https://doi.org/10.1145/3204949.3204952		328-338	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3204949.3204952,

330	DTCPS	Towards Security-Aware Virtual Environments for Digital Twins	Digital twins open up new possibilities in terms of monitoring, simulating, optimizing and predicting the state of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Furthermore, we argue that a fully functional, virtual replica of a CPS can also play an important role in securing the system. In this work, we present a framework that allows users to create and execute digital twins, closely matching their physical counterparts. We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.	simulation;  security monitoring;  industrial control systems;  digital twin;  cyber-physical systems;  automationml	Eckhart, Matthias; Ekelhart, Andreas	CPSS '18: Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical System Security	https://doi.org/10.1145/3198458.3198464		61-72	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3198458.3198464,

332	DTCPS	INSpIRA: iNtegrating security into risk assessment: doctoral project paper	Today's software and hardware technologies enable the expansion of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) into the realms of mobility (car2x, autonomous driving), energy (power plants, smart grid) and healthcare (health monitoring), paving the way into a highly interlaced world. However, this also dramatically broadens the threat landscape for potential attacks on CPSs. The malfunction of these CPSs could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss [5, 9, 16]. This drives the need for comprehensive methods that support the cross-domain design, development and implementation of safe and secure systems [3, 4]. In order to tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a method called INSpIRA, a method for INtegrating Security Into Risk Assessment, including a toolchain implementing the method. The envisioned method is supposed to be a holistic approach that supports the efficient cross-domain design, development, implementation and maintenance of dependable CPSs, where security and safety are a critical aspect that requires an in-depth risk assessment.

333	DTCPS	Digital Transformation, Smart Factories, and Virtual Design: Contributions of Subject Orientation	Many concepts of process management are being intensively discussed in current research. The background is often that within the megatrend of digitization, workflows are automated. Furthermore, processes are fundamentally reconsidered in the digital transformation of organizations. What contribution S-BPM can make in the future of digital process management is analyzed in this paper aiming at the anniversary conference of S-BPM. As basis for the analysis serves the idea that, the suitability of BPM concepts (such as S-BPM) for certain application domains depends on essential process properties. Based on an assessment model we analyze under what conditions subject orientation can be well used (e.g., focus on collaboration). Using these results, we are evaluating the opportunities of S-BPM for the digital future. The evaluation is based on the three exemplary trends (i) digital development/products, (ii) digital production and (iii) digital business transformation. In these trend, we asses which conditions change (e.g. fast changing environments, machine-to-machine-communication, user-centered thinking) and to what degree S-BPM can still contribute in the new digital world.

334	DTCPS	A comparison between discrete analysis and a multiphase approach for predicting heat conduction in packed beds	The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a Lagrangian approach initially developed for predicting particles flow. The eXtended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) framework, developed at the LuXDEM Research Centre of the University of Luxembourg, extends DEM by including the thermochemical state of particles, as well as their interaction with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) domain. The level of detail of its predictions makes the XDEM suite a powerful tool for predicting complex industrial processes like steel making, powder metallurgy and additive manufacturing. Like in any other DEM software, the critical aspect of the simulations is the computation requirement that grows rapidly as the number of particles increases. Indeed, such burden currently represents the main bottleneck to its full exploitation in large-scale scenarios. Digital Twin, a research project founded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), aims at drastically accelerate XDEM through different approaches and make it an effective tool for numerical predictions in industry as well as virtual prototyping. The Multiphase Particle-In-Cell (MP-PIC) method has been introduced for reducing the computation burden of DEM. It has been initially developed for predicting particles flow and uses a two-way transfer of information between the Lagrangian entities and a computation grid. The method avoids explicit contact detection and can potentially achieve a drastic reduction of the time-to-solution respect to DEM. The present contribution introduces a multiphase approach for predicting the conductive heat transfer within a static packed bed of particles. Results from a test case are qualitatively and quantitatively compared against reference XDEM predictions. The method can be effectively exploited in combination with MP-PIC for predicting the thermochemical state of particles.

338	DTCPS	A Blockchain-Based Approach for the Creation of Digital Twins	The rapid advancements in computing, storage, communications, and networking technologies have enabled the creation of Digital Twins (DTs). A DT is a digital representation of a real-world physical component, product, or equipment. A DT can be used for 3-D design, testing, simulation, and prototyping prior to the manufacturing of the physical component. Once a physical component is in operation, a DT can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. It is expected that DTs will gain significant attention in the foreseeable future, and will play a key role in Industry 4.0. However, today's approaches, systems, and technologies leveraged for the creation of DTs are mostly centralized and fall short of providing trusted data provenance, audit, and traceability. Also, data related to transactions, logs, and history are not secure or tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based creation process of DTs to guarantee secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, logs, and data provenance. Our proposed approach uses smart contracts to govern and track transactions initiated by participants involved in the creation of DTs. Our approach also employs decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems to store and share DTs data. Moreover, we present details on our system design and architecture, implementation, and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide security and cost analysis, and show how our approach fulfills the requirements of DTs process creation. We make the smart contract code for creating DTs publicly available on Github.

339	DTCPS	Transparent Digital Twin for Output Control Using Belief Rule Base	A transparent digital twin (DT) is designed for output control using the belief rule base (BRB), namely, DT-BRB. The goal of the transparent DT-BRB is not only to model the complex relationships between the system inputs and output but also to conduct output control by identifying and optimizing the key parameters in the model inputs. The proposed DT-BRB approach is composed of three major steps. First, BRB is adopted to model the relationships between the inputs and output of the physical system. Second, an analytical procedure is proposed to identify only the key parameters in the system inputs with the highest contribution to the output. Being consistent with the inferencing, integration, and unification procedures of BRB, there are also three parts in the contribution calculation in this step. Finally, the data-driven optimization is performed to control the system output. A practical case study on the Wuhan Metro System is conducted for reducing the building tilt rate (BTR) in tunnel construction. By comparing the results following different standards, the 80% contribution standard is proved to have the highest marginal contribution that identifies only 43.5% parameters as the key parameters but can reduce the BTR by 73.73%. Moreover, it is also observed that the proposed DT-BRB approach is so effective that iterative optimizations are not necessarily needed.

353	DTCPS	Scalable Sensor Models and Simulation Methods for Seamless Transitions Within System Development: From First Digital Prototype to Final Real System	Highly automated systems are taking over an increasing number of human tasks. This includes not only the execution of certain actions but also perception and interpretation of the environment. Here, environment-perceiving sensor systems such as camera, lidar, or radar represent a key technology while posing a major challenge in terms of complex physical interactions that make validation very complicated. Typically, required system tests within dynamic environments are enabled too late, while real-world testing is neither efficient nor sufficient. Striving for a seamless transition from a first digital prototype to the final real system, we propose the use of digital twins and hybrid testbeds. These combine real and simulated components per availability or requirement to continuously enable simulation-based validation in all stages of development. To this end, we present an overall concept of scalable sensor models and simulation methods that meet the varying requirements along the development process by introducing a triple-axis scalability. Here, reusable building blocks allow for scaling across different sensor types and applications with varying level of detail, while natural interfaces and measurement-accurate ground truth annotators ensure a seamless integration into the underlying development process using methods of X-in-the-loop.

357	DTCPS	Towards Cybersecurity of the Smart Grid Using Digital Twins	The proliferation of cyber-physical systems is driving the growing need to establish links between these systems and virtual environments. Particularly in the smart grid, the high costs of some devices and the imminent need to prevent manipulation of these devices in production environments make mechanisms that allow the manipulation of these physical objects in virtual environments necessary; this has been called a digital twin (DT). Conversley, cyberattacks are growing in all cyber-physical systems and cybersecurity is essential to the critical infrastructure of the smart grid. This work shows a small implementation of a DT system for smart metering systems in a smart home environment for testing cybersecurity issues. The results show that the use of DTs is feasible in various contexts of the smart grid, particularly in cybersecurity testing.

360	DTCPS	Model-Based Systems Engineering Tool-Chain for Automated Parameter Value Selection	Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate heterogeneous systems and process sensor data using digital services. As the complexity of CPS increases, it becomes more challenging to efficiently formalize the integrated multidomain views with flexible automated verification across the entire lifecycle. This article illustrates a model-based systems engineering tool-chain to support CPS development with an emphasis on automated parameter value selection for co-simulation. First, a domain-specific modeling approach is introduced to support the formalizations of CPS artifacts, development processes, and simulation configurations. The domain-specific models are used as the basis to generate a Web-based process management system for automated parameter value selections, which coordinates Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration services of development information and technical resources (models, data, and tools) in order to support automated co-simulation. The services are deployed by a service orchestrator based on a decision-making algorithm for parameter value selection. Finally, developers make use of the WPMS to implement simulations and to select system parameter values for co-simulation automatically. The approach is illustrated by a case study on auto-braking system development and we evaluate the efficiency of this tool-chain by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that parameter values are selected more efficiently and effectively when implementing co-simulations using our tool-chain.

As the complexity of CPS increases, it becomes more challenging to efficiently formalize the integrated multidomain views with flexible automated verification across the entire lifecycle. This article illustrates a model-based systems engineering tool-chain to support CPS development with an emphasis on automated parameter value selection for co-simulation. First, a domain-specific modeling approach is introduced to support the formalizations of CPS artifacts, development processes, and simulation configurations. The domain-specific models are used as the basis to generate a Web-based process management system for automated parameter value selections, which coordinates Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration services of development information and technical resources (models, data, and tools) in order to support automated co-simulation. The services are deployed by a service orchestrator based on a decision-making algorithm for parameter value selection. Finally, developers make use of the WPMS to implement simulations and to select system parameter values for co-simulation automatically. The approach is illustrated by a case study on auto-braking system development and we evaluate the efficiency of this tool-chain by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that parameter values are selected more efficiently and effectively when implementing co-simulations using our tool-chain."",

361	DTCPS	On the Implementation of IoT-Based Digital Twin for Networked Microgrids Resiliency Against Cyber Attacks	The increased rate of cyber-attacks on the power system necessitates the need for innovative solutions to ensure its resiliency. This work builds on the advancement in the IoT to provide a practical framework that is able to respond to multiple attacks on a network of interconnected microgrids. This paper provides an IoT-based digital twin (DT) of the cyber-physical system that interacts with the control system to ensure its proper operation. The IoT cloud provision of the energy cyber-physical and the DT are mathematically formulated. Unlike other cybersecurity frameworks in the literature, the proposed one can mitigate an individual as well as coordinated attacks. The framework is tested on a distributed control system and the security measures are implemented using cloud computing. The physical controllers are implemented using single-board computers. The practical results show that the proposed DT is able to mitigate the coordinated false data injection and the denial of service cyber-attacks.

362	DTCPS	Symbiotic System of Systems Design for Safe and Resilient Autonomous Robotics in Offshore Wind Farms	To reduce Operation and Maintenance (O&M) expenditure on offshore wind farms, wherein 80% of the cost relates to deploying personnel, the offshore wind sector looks to advances in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) for solutions. Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot. This evaluation demonstrates that the SSOSA provides enhanced run-time operational resilience and safety compliance to BVLOS autonomous missions. The SSOSA has the potential to be a highly transferable methodology to other mission scenarios and technologies, providing a pathway to implementing scalable autonomy as a service.

372	DTCPS	Digital Twins-Based Online Monitoring of TFE-731 Turbofan Engine Using Fast Orthogonal Search	Due to the complicated structure of the aircraft engine, it is hard to observe the damage and determine its status with the traditional diagnosis method, which sets a fixed threshold for some specific parameters. To accurately reflect the condition of the engine, this article provides a novel fault diagnosis method for the TFE-731 turbofan engine and develops an online diagnosis system. With the combinations of model-based and data-driven approaches, models are constructed to create the so-called digital twins of the engine parameters. For the model-based approach, the physical isentropic compression is used as the basis of the model. For the data-driven approach, the fast orthogonal search is utilized to ensure that the model outputs close to the real engine data. Based on the model prediction-based monitoring strategy, the status of the engine can be identified online. By using the proposed method, an alarm will be triggered once the tested engine outputs cross the boundaries generated by the digital twins. This method can be further applied in quality control to examine the abnormal parts of an aircraft engine. Finally, the digital twins' online diagnosis system is realized in the practical TFE-731 test facility, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.

378	DTCPS	Intelligent Digital Twin-Based Software-Defined Vehicular Networks	SDVN is a promising architecture to extend the computation resources which break through the limitations of current vehicular networks. It is possible to learn new networking schemes by observing the surrounding environment in SDVN. However, within SDVN, the construction and application of such schemes still lack proper consideration in data collection, prediction, verification, and validation before applying these schemes in the real network, which is due to the limited knowledge of the physical environment. Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) was initially designed for realizing intelligent manufacturing by virtualizing and learning the data of the physical space in cyberspace. Hence, bringing IDT to networking can provide additional valuable functionalities to meet the above considerations by constructing a virtual intelligent network space, aiming to realize the iterative update of the networking schemes in an adaptive way. In this article, we introduce a new network architecture, IDT-SDVN, by maximizing the advantages of SDVNs. We present the challenges and open issues of IDT-SDVNs. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of SDVNs. The experimental results show that significant improvement of performance is achieved for vehicular networking with the proposed IDT-SDVNs.

379	DTCPS	Digital Twinning Based Adaptive Development Environment for Automotive Cyber-Physical Systems	Automotive cyber-physical systems need to be rigorously checked and tested under various physical conditions. Automakers aim to improve development efficiency of the automotive cyber-physical systems in the fierce market competition. However, the actual development process suffers from the challenges of long development cycle and poor scalability. To tackle these challenges, this article develops a digital twinning based adaptive development environment for automotive cyber-physical systems, which addresses two critical problems: each physical entity (i.e., electronic control unit, component, test source, etc.) needs to clone a corresponding digital twin; digital twins and the physical entities need to interact closely. The first problem is addressed through proposing an integrated digital twinning clone flow. The second problem is addressed through developing a smart digital twinning board. Our case study with the automotive body control system demonstrates that the adaptive development environment achieves a high adaptability with short development cycle, low complexity, low cost, high scalability, and high flexibility, which meet various automotive cyber-physical design requirements during the development process.

    abstract = ""Automotive cyber-physical systems need to be rigorously checked and tested under various physical conditions. Automakers aim to improve development efficiency of the automotive cyber-physical systems in the fierce market competition. However, the actual development process suffers from the challenges of long development cycle and poor scalability. To tackle these challenges, this article develops a digital twinning based adaptive development environment for automotive cyber-physical systems, which addresses two critical problems: each physical entity (i.e., electronic control unit, component, test source, etc.) needs to clone a corresponding digital twin; digital twins and the physical entities need to interact closely. The first problem is addressed through proposing an integrated digital twinning clone flow. The second problem is addressed through developing a smart digital twinning board. Our case study with the automotive body control system demonstrates that the adaptive development environment achieves a high adaptability with short development cycle, low complexity, low cost, high scalability, and high flexibility, which meet various automotive cyber-physical design requirements during the development process."",

385	DTCPS	ELEGANT: Security of Critical Infrastructures With Digital Twins	The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.

386	DTCPS	Simulation-Based Digital Twin Development for Blockchain Enabled End-to-End Industrial Hemp Supply Chain Risk Management	With the passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, Industrial Hemp production is moved from limited pilot programs to a regulated agriculture production system. However, Industrial Hemp Supply Chain (IHSC) faces critical challenges, including high complexity and variability, very limited production knowledge, and lack of data/information tracking. In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a simulation-based digital twin for IHSC management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making. Our empirical study demonstrates the promising performance of proposed platform.

390	DTCPS	Intrusion Detection in Digital Twins for Industrial Control Systems	Nowadays, the growth of advanced technologies is paving the way for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and making them more efficient and smarter. However, this makes ICS more connected to communication networks that provide a potential platform for attackers to intrude into the systems and cause damage and catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose implementing digital twins that have been equipped with an intrusion detection algorithm. Our novel algorithm is able to detect attacks in a timely manner and also diagnose the type of attack by classification of different types of attacks. With digital twins, which are a new concept in ICS, we have virtual replicas of physical systems so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of the physical systems. So by placing the intrusion detection algorithm in digital twins, security tests can be done remotely without risking negative impacts on live systems.

391	DTCPS	Roads Infrastructure Digital Twin: A Step Toward Smarter Cities Realization	Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360deg camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360deg live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360deg web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security. To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.

    abstract = ""Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360deg camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360deg live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360deg web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security. To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart mobility, using the Digital Twin Box."",

393	DTCPS	Method to Interface Grid-Forming Inverters into Power Hardware in the Loop Setups	During the last decade, utility companies around the world have experienced a significant increase in the occurrences of either planned or unplanned blackouts, and microgrids have emerged as a viable solution to improve grid resiliency and robustness. Recently, power converters with grid-forming capabilities have attracted interest from researchers and utilities as keystone devices enabling modern microgrid architectures. Therefore, proper and thorough testing of Grid-Forming Inverters (GFMIs) is crucial to understand their dynamics and limitations before they are deployed. The use of closed-loop real-time Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) simulations will facilitate the testing of GFMIs using a digital twin of the power system under various contingency scenarios within a controlled environment. So far, lower to medium scale commercially available GFMIs are difficult to interface into PHIL simulations because of their lack of a synchronization mechanism that allows a smooth and stable interconnection with a voltage source such as a power amplifier. Under this scenario, the use of the well-known Ideal Transformer Method to create a PHIL setup can lead to catastrophic damages of the GFMI. This paper addresses a simple but novel method to interface commercially available GFMIs into a PHIL testbed. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is stable and accurate under standalone operation with abrupt (step) load-changing dynamics, followed by the corresponding steady state behavior. Such results were validated against the dynamics of the GFMI connected to a linear load bank.

403	DTCPS	Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing of Modern On-Board Power Systems Using Digital Twins	Simulation has always played an important role in the development, integration and deployment of aircraft, land vehicles and naval ships. Ever-increasing system design complexity also increased the necessity for more stringent testing and integration capabilities of these new topologies. Real-time simulators can be very useful tools to test, validate and integrate these complex devices. Maintenance and subsystem upgrades, common issues in such complex systems, cannot be easily done on the real systems, especially on larger systems like those in navy ships. This is when a real-time digital replica with Hardware-In-the-Loop capability is very useful. This type of system is also known as a 'Digital Twin'. This approach is compatible with model-based design; a design philosophy that is based entirely on simulation models, from the specifications to release and field commissioning. In this paper, we describe the Digital Twin approach and explain it in the context of navy ships. Such systems usually integrate many subsystems, such as traction systems, power generation and auxiliary systems, all connected through various communication links. The test and integration requirements for such vehicle or land systems affect several levels of the control hierarchy; from low-level power electronic converters used for propulsion and auxiliary systems to high-level supervisory controls. In this paper, we will describe a HIL test made on a simplified zonal power system of a navy ship.

404	DTCPS	Digital Twin for Human-Robot Interactive Welding and Welder Behavior Analysis	This paper presents an innovative investigation on prototyping a digital twin (DT) as the platform for human-robot interactive welding and welder behavior analysis. This human-robot interaction (HRI) working style helps to enhance human users' operational productivity and comfort; while data-driven welder behavior analysis benefits to further novice welder training. This HRI system includes three modules: 1) a human user who demonstrates the welding operations offsite with her/his operations recorded by the motion-tracked handles; 2) a robot that executes the demonstrated welding operations to complete the physical welding tasks onsite; 3) a DT system that is developed based on virtual reality (VR) as a digital replica of the physical human-robot interactive welding environment. The DT system bridges a human user and robot through a bi-directional information flow: a) transmitting demonstrated welding operations in VR to the robot in the physical environment; b) displaying the physical welding scenes to human users in VR. Compared to existing DT systems reported in the literatures, the developed one provides better capability in engaging human users in interacting with welding scenes, through an augmented VR. To verify the effectiveness, six welders, skilled with certain manual welding training and unskilled without any training, tested the system by completing the same welding job; three skilled welders produce satisfied welded workpieces, while the other three unskilled do not. A data-driven approach as a combination of fast Fourier transform (FFT), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM) is developed to analyze their behaviors. Given an operation sequence, i.e., motion speed sequence of the welding torch, frequency features are firstly extracted by FFT and then reduced in dimension through PCA, which are finally routed into SVM for classification. The trained model demonstrates a 94.44% classification accuracy in the testing dataset. ...

405	DTCPS	Industrial IoT and Digital Twins for a Smart Factory : An open source toolkit for application design and benchmarking	The rapid evolution of digital technology and designed intelligence, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), has been a catalyst for the 4th industrial revolution (known as industry 4.0). Among other, the two key state-of-the-art concepts in Industry 4.0, are Industrial IoT (IIoT) and digital twins. IIoT facilitates real-time data acquisition, processing and analytics over large amount of sensor data streams produced by sensors installed within a smart factory, while the 'digital twin' concept aims to enable smart factories via the digital replication or representation of physical machines, processes, people in cyber-space. This paper explores the capability of present-state open-source platforms to collectively achieve digital twin capabilities, including IoT real-time data acquisition, virtual representation, analytics, and visualisation. The aim of this work is to 'close the gap' between research and implementation, through a collective open source IoT and Digital Twin architecture. The performance of the open-source architecture in this work, is demonstrated in a use-case utilising industry 'open data', and is bench-marked with universal testing tools.

407	DTCPS	Dynamic fault injection into digital twins of safety-critical systems	In this work we present a technology for dynamically introducing fault structures into digital twins without the need to change the virtual prototype model. The injection is done at the beginning of a simulation by dynamically rewiring the involved netlists. During the simulation on a realtime platform, faults can be activated or deactivated triggered by sequences, statistical effects or by events from the real world. In some cases the fault structures can even be auto-generated directly from a formal specification, which further automates the development process for safety-relevant systems. The approach is demonstrated at a SystemC/ SystemC AMS virtual prototype of a safety-critical sub-systems which runs on a dSPACE real-time hardware.

The injection is done at the beginning of a simulation by dynamically rewiring the involved netlists. During the simulation on a realtime platform, faults can be activated or deactivated triggered by sequences, statistical effects or by events from the real world. In some cases the fault structures can even be auto-generated directly from a formal specification, which further automates the development process for safety-relevant systems. The approach is demonstrated at a SystemC/ SystemC AMS virtual prototype of a safety-critical sub-systems which runs on a dSPACE real-time hardware."",

410	DTCPS	Design, Modeling, and Experimental Verification of a Hall-Effect-Based Linear Instrumentation System for Through-Shaft Angle Sensing	This article presents a simple instrumentation system for sensing the angular position of a through shaft. The system, broadly, consists of two parts: 1) a Hall-effect-based sensor module (SM) consisting of a twin eccentric-disc rotating arrangement and 2) a linearizing digital converter (LDC), which acts as an efficient interface for the transducer part. The SM provides cubic-natured push-pull outputs with respect to the angle. The linearizer further accepts these signals, performs a voltage-to-frequency transformation, and then applies novel linearization function to render a linear direct-digital indication of the angle. The article discusses the design and theoretical modeling of the SM, and its characteristics are derived. The sensor characteristics observed from simulation are in agreement with theoretical studies. Simulations are also extended to study the effect of important mechanical/magnetic parameters of the SM. Optimal parameter values are also inferred from these studies. The LDC and associated methodologies are also studied and presented in the article. The performance of the instrumentation system is validated using a hardware model of the SM and a prototype of the LDC. The experimental results show that the sensor and linearizer work as expected. Interfacing tests show that the overall instrumentation system gives an accuracy of less than 0.4% and a resolution of 0.2deg over a wide range.

414	DTCPS	Controller-Embeddable Probabilistic Real-Time Digital Twins for Power Electronic Converter Diagnostics	In this article, an approach is proposed for the online diagnostic analysis of power electronic converters utilizing real-time, probabilistic digital twinning. Under this approach, a digital twin (DT) of a power converter is defined as a real-time, probabilistic simulation model with stochastic (random) variables, developed using generalized polynomial chaos expansion. The DT models are partitioned in perspective of control layers for power converter subsystems in the approach, with emphasis on the application and converter control layers. Real-time executed solvers of these divided probabilistic DT models are embedded into power converter controllers running on field programmable gate array (FPGA) computing devices. Using a monitoring system, the real-time probabilistic DTs at each control layer and the corresponding physical twins of the power converter are compared by the controllers to determine if the power converter is operating within probable behavior. Knowing the large computational cost of probabilistic modeling, the resource usage and timing of real-time DT solvers on modern FPGAs is reported for common power electronic converter topologies, showing the approach is feasible and able to perform probabilistic real-time simulation of smaller power converters in perspective of application and converter control layers using <=2 ms time steps, with as low as 70 ns steps; while staying embeddable within FPGA-based controllers. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed approach, a case study is presented using a probabilistic DT in the application layer controller of a pair of converters to comparatively monitor their behavior and corresponding controller action under hardware-in-the-loop testing.

415	DTCPS	High performance wideband digital predistortion platform for 3G+ applications with better than 55dBc over 40 MHz bandwidth	In this paper, a hardware-software system is proposed for the wideband characterization and linearization of power amplifiers exhibiting memory effects. The designed prototype includes a signal generation and a feedback paths for applications in the 1GHz to 2.5GHz frequency band and supports instantaneous bandwidths of up to 60MHz. The hardware platform is coupled with a software interface that implements the required data processing algorithms for the synthesis of the digital predistortion function. Experimental validation is carried out on a 3G power amplifier driven by an eight-carrier WCDMA signal.

416	DTCPS	Digital Twin Models of Power Electronic Converters Using Dynamic Neural Networks	This paper presents a new approach for creating real-time models of power electronic converters using dynamic neural networks. The models are time-domain, switch-averaged, large-signal, real-time, and embeddable. This combination of characteristics renders the model uniquely suited to create digital twins of the converter which can run on any platform, including locally on the converter's digital controller. The training dataset for the proposed neural network model can be generated from simulation (rather than measured on a hardware prototype) for convenience. This work will suggest a rationale for choosing the neural network structure and hyperparameters, will discuss best practices for training and testing the model, and will include an analysis of model error. The proposed modeling approach is compared and contrasted with other real-time modeling approaches and shown to be superior to previously proposed machine learning approaches.

422	DTCPS	Exploring Virtual Reality as an Integrated Development Environment for Cyber-Physical Systems	Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) development approaches tend to start from the physical (hardware) perspective, and the software is the final element in the process. However, this approach is unfit for the more software-intensive world that is increasingly iterative, connected, and constantly online. Many constraints prevent the application of iterative, incremental, and agile development methodologies, which now are the norm for many other fields of software. Time-consuming system validation can only start when both hardware and software components are ready, which implies that the software delivery and quality is almost always the final bottleneck in the CPS development and integration. Also organizational issues raise concerns - CPS development teams are nowadays often geographically distributed, which can result in delays in the process, shortcomings, and even mistakes. In this paper, we propose using our envisioned open-source Virtual Reality-based Integrated software Development Environment (VRIDE) for developing the next generation, increasingly software-intensive CPSs in efficient ways.

423	DTCPS	Digital Twins as a Key Technology for Ensuring Effective Modernization of Complex Industrial Systems	The paper considers the problem of the operation maintenance of complex soft- and hardware systems, for example, automated control systems of industrial objects, when individual components of the system become unavailable for replacement in case of their failure or for other reasons. When the replacement components differ from those that were designed at the system creation stage, the upgrade task arises. System upgrades require a complete cycle of work on validating both the replaceable components and the changed system itself. The system itself, if it is included in the life cycle of an existing industrial object, actually cannot be used as a testbed of the new components; generally, full-size system layouts are used for the testbed, and the complexity of those layouts may be comparable to the system itself. The inclusion of the digital twin in the life cycle of the object and its control system allows to effectively solve the problem of system modification (individual components replacement) in this case. The digital twin is not only a cheaper analog of the system that can be used for testing; due to the properties that allow parallel testing for several copies and to influence the model time within certain limits, it provides a higher quality of testing.

    abstract = ""The paper considers the problem of the operation maintenance of complex soft- and hardware systems, for example, automated control systems of industrial objects, when individual components of the system become unavailable for replacement in case of their failure or for other reasons. When the replacement components differ from those that were designed at the system creation stage, the upgrade task arises. System upgrades require a complete cycle of work on validating both the replaceable components and the changed system itself. The system itself, if it is included in the life cycle of an existing industrial object, actually cannot be used as a testbed of the new components; generally, full-size system layouts are used for the testbed, and the complexity of those layouts may be comparable to the system itself. The inclusion of the digital twin in the life cycle of the object and its control system allows to effectively solve the problem of system modification (individual components replacement) in this case. The digital twin is not only a cheaper analog of the system that can be used for testing; due to the properties that allow parallel testing for several copies and to influence the model time within certain limits, it provides a higher quality of testing."",

424	DTCPS	Digital Twin-enabled MBSE Testbed for Prototyping and Evaluating Aerospace Systems: Lessons Learned	With increasing interconnectedness and complexity of aerospace systems and system-of-systems, it no longer suffices to perform experimentation and integration without an overarching framework to organize modeling, simulation, and analysis artifacts. With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control.

427	DTCPS	Digital Twin Modeling for Photovoltaic Panels Based on Hybrid Neural Network	An data-driven approach for Photovoltaic(PV) panel digital twin is proposed and practised in this paper. A hybrid neural network is applied to simulate PV power-voltage characteristics. Various environmental features such as uneven lighting conditions, temperature and humidity are selected and modified to manifest the physical mechanism to the utmost extent. Additionally a reduction method for lighting conditions as well as an improved genetic coding scheme are adopted to optimize the digital twin parameters. Above-mentioned data is acquired from an IoT management platform linked to specific PV panel and applied in the practice of digital twin modeling, performance of which is verified and discussed at the very end. The conclusions show that the digital twin is able to restore PV power-voltage characteristics under various lighting conditions as the average error of the testing simulation results is within 6%.

A hybrid neural network is applied to simulate PV power-voltage characteristics. Various environmental features such as uneven lighting conditions, temperature and humidity are selected and modified to manifest the physical mechanism to the utmost extent. Additionally a reduction method for lighting conditions as well as an improved genetic coding scheme are adopted to optimize the digital twin parameters. Above-mentioned data is acquired from an IoT management platform linked to specific PV panel and applied in the practice of digital twin modeling, performance of which is verified and discussed at the very end. The conclusions show that the digital twin is able to restore PV power-voltage characteristics under various lighting conditions as the average error of the testing simulation results is within 6\%."",

428	DTCPS	Digital Twin-based Anomaly Detection in Cyber-physical Systems	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are susceptible to various anomalies during their operations. Thus, it is important to detect such anomalies. Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively. Moreover, ATTAIN achieved on average 8.39% increase in the anomaly detection capability with digital twins as compared with an approach of not using digital twins.

430	DTCPS	Digital Twin Extension with Extra-Functional Properties	Digital twins of production lines do not focus solely on the management of the production process, they can also monitor and optimize other extra-functional aspects such as energy consumption and communications. This paper proposes the extension of digital twin concept in such directions. First, we extend the digital twin with models of energy consumption, that allow the monitoring of production line components throughout production lifetime. Then, we propose a flow to design the communication network starting from information obtained from the digital twin concerning the production, usage and flowing of information through the plant. All these methodologies start from the production line specification, then they enrich it with data collected during operation, and finally information is used to perform design and optimization. Results have been shown on a real Industry 4.0 research facility.

431	DTCPS	DigiMobot: Digital Twin for Human-Robot Collaboration in Indoor Environments	Human-robot collaboration and cooperation are critical for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in order to use them in indoor environments, such as offices, hospitals, libraries, schools, factories, and warehouses. Since a long transition period might be required to fully automate such facilities, we have to deploy AMRs while improving safety in the mixed environments of human and mobile robots. In addition, human behaviors in such environments might be difficult to predict. In this paper, we present a Digital Twin for Autonomous Mobile Robots system named DigiMobot to support, manage, monitor, and validate AMRs in indoor environments. First, DigiMobot can simulate human behaviors and robot movements to verify and validate AMRs to improve safety in a virtual world. Secondly, DigiMobot can monitor and manage AMRs in the physical world by collecting sensor data from each robot in real-time. Since DigiMobot enables us to test the robot systems in the virtual world, we can deploy and implement AMRs in each facility without any modifications. To show the feasibility of DigiMobot, we develop a software framework and two different types of autonomous mobile robots. Finally, we conduct real-world experiments in a warehouse located in Saitama, Japan, in which more than 400, 000 items are stored for commercial purposes.

Since a long transition period might be required to fully automate such facilities, we have to deploy AMRs while improving safety in the mixed environments of human and mobile robots. In addition, human behaviors in such environments might be difficult to predict. In this paper, we present a Digital Twin for Autonomous Mobile Robots system named DigiMobot to support, manage, monitor, and validate AMRs in indoor environments. First, DigiMobot can simulate human behaviors and robot movements to verify and validate AMRs to improve safety in a virtual world. Secondly, DigiMobot can monitor and manage AMRs in the physical world by collecting sensor data from each robot in real-time. Since DigiMobot enables us to test the robot systems in the virtual world, we can deploy and implement AMRs in each facility without any modifications. To show the feasibility of DigiMobot, we develop a software framework and two different types of autonomous mobile robots. Finally, we conduct real-world experiments in a warehouse located in Saitama, Japan, in which more than 400, 000 items are stored for commercial purposes."",

432	DTCPS	Cyber Protection of Grid-Connected Devices Through Embedded Online Security	Cybersecurity research regarding the electric power grid has primarily been focused on protecting the communication layer of grid-connected devices against cyber-attack threats. Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device's controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system.

433	DTCPS	Digital Twin Design for Thermal Power Plant Cooling System using Fuzzy System	With technological advances, the industrial sector is using enabling technologies based on the concepts of Industry 4.0, among them the modeling of systems based on Digital Twins, which allow building models of real physical systems from field measurements, with the ability to follow the dynamic system changes. This article describes the development of a digital twin for a cooling system based on data from the sensors of a thermal power plant. The digital twin created used data from a plant currently in operation at the major system, and the automatic rules extraction approach from the test database was used to form the model's knowledge database. The principal component analysis technique was used to reduce the dimensionality of the system to reduce the computational effort of the model. An algorithm for automatic update of rules during the operation of the digital twin was also proposed, making the model learn during the operation even without the need to retrain and, consequently, reduce error of the model's response in the short term.

435	DTCPS	Design of a Low-Power Coprocessor for Mid-Size Vocabulary Speech Recognition Systems	Speech recognition systems have gained popularity in consumer electronics. This paper presents a custom-designed coprocessor for output probability calculation (OPC), which is the most computation-intensive processing step in continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM)-based speech recognition algorithms. To save hardware resource and reduce power consumption, a polynomial addition-based method is used to compute add-log instead of the traditional look-up table-based method. In addition, the optimal tradeoff between speech processing delay, energy consumption, and hardware resources is explored for the coprocessor. The proposed coprocessor has been implemented and tested in Xilinx Spartan-3A DSP XC3SD3400A, and also validated using the standard-cell-based approach in IBM 0.13 mm technology. To implement an entire speech recognition system, SAMSUNG S3C44b0X (containing an ARM7) is used as the micro-controller to execute the rest of speech processing. Tested with a 358-state 3-mixture 27-feature 800-word HMM, S3C44b0X operates at 40 MHz and coprocessor at 10 MHz to meet the real-time requirement, and the recognition accuracy is 95.2%. Power consumption of the micro-controller is 10 mW, and that of the coprocessor 15.2 mW. The overall speech recognition system achieves the lowest energy consumption per word recognition among many reported designs. Experiment and analysis show that the speech recognition system based on the proposed coprocessor is especially suitable for mid-size vocabulary (100-1000 words) recognition tasks.

439	DTCPS	Development of a computer twins-based wind farm testbed	As the contribution of wind energy to the power grid increases, serious concern about its influence on the dynamic behavior of the power system has also increased. This has raised the need for advanced analysis and simulation tools that can study the complicated dynamic behavior of wind turbines, test their controllers as well as emulate a complex power grid. Therefore, to meet all the aforementioned goals, a reconfigurable hybrid wind farm testbed has been developed and implemented into a real-time simulation platform that has eight CPUs. The proposed wind farm testbed includes a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) system involving a Doubly-fed Induction Machine (DFIM) test setup and wind turbine controllers. The wind farm model is also tested under normal and abnormal grid conditions. Several types of system symmetrical and asymmetrical faults are investigated. The first is a two-phase to ground fault at the point of common coupling (PCC) and the second is a three-phase to ground fault. An innovative approach referred to as Computer Twins is employed to react to these faults and maintain the stability of the power grid. A comprehensive set of test results are presented in this paper to demonstrate the capability of proposed testbed.

441	DTCPS	Condition Monitoring of Power Electronic Systems Through Data Analysis of Measurement Signals and Control Output Variables	A major disadvantage of existing condition monitoring methods is the need for additional sensors and measuring equipment. In this work, this disadvantage is eliminated by completely avoiding additional hardware. Instead, software-based methods from the field of machine learning are used. Therefore, measurement signals and control output variables are utilized, which are acquired and processed in any power electronic system for the purpose of converter control. The publication focuses on two main converter components: power semiconductors and dc-link capacitor. For each component, the aging mechanisms that have been studied in the literature are explained. Based on the aging mechanisms, the degradation indicators are identified. Then, a converter model is built that allows the variation of degradation indicators in order to analyze their effects on the available dataset. These findings form the basis for mathematical models, which detects future failure mechanisms of this type during converter operation. The test setup must offer the possibility of generating reproducible failure cases in various components with the aid of additional failure equipment. Finally, failure mechanisms are intentionally introduced at the test bench in order to validate the methodology of the developed approach.

442	DTCPS	Cooperative Federated Learning and Model Update Verification in Blockchain-Empowered Digital Twin Edge Networks	With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to connect physical components with digital space for better optimization of physical systems. However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction.

443	DTCPS	A Digital-Twin-Assisted Fault Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning	Digital twin is a significant way to achieve smart manufacturing, and provides a new paradigm for fault diagnosis. Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented. The results show the superiority and feasibility of our proposed method.

445	DTCPS	Cyber-Physical Data Fusion in Surrogate- Assisted Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm for PHEV Energy Management Optimization	"This article proposes a new form of algorithm environment for the multiobjective optimization of an energy management system in plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). The surrogate-assisted strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SSPEA) is developed to optimize the power-split control parameters guided by the data from the physical PHEV and its digital twins (DTs). By introducing a ""confidence factor,"" the SSPEA uses the fused data of physically measured and virtually simulated vehicle performances (energy consumption and remaining battery state of charge) to converge the optimization process. Gaussian noisy models are adopted to emulate the real vehicle system on the hardware-in-the-loop platform for experimental evaluation. The testing results suggest that the proposed SSPEA requires less R&D costs than the model-free method that only uses the physical information, and more than 44.6% energy can be saved during the R&D process. Driven by the SSPEA, the optimized energy management system surpasses other non-DT-assisted systems by saving more than 4.8% energy."

    abstract = ""This article proposes a new form of algorithm environment for the multiobjective optimization of an energy management system in plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). The surrogate-assisted strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SSPEA) is developed to optimize the power-split control parameters guided by the data from the physical PHEV and its digital twins (DTs). By introducing a ""confidence factor,"" the SSPEA uses the fused data of physically measured and virtually simulated vehicle performances (energy consumption and remaining battery state of charge) to converge the optimization process. Gaussian noisy models are adopted to emulate the real vehicle system on the hardware-in-the-loop platform for experimental evaluation. The testing results suggest that the proposed SSPEA requires less R\&D costs than the model-free method that only uses the physical information, and more than 44.6\% energy can be saved during the R\&D process. Driven by the SSPEA, the optimized energy management system surpasses other non-DT-assisted systems by saving more than 4.8\% energy."",

448	DTCPS	Application Status and Prospect of Digital Twin for On-Orbit Spacecraft	With cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and other new information technologies going into space, the era of space intelligence is coming. The spacecraft is facing more frequent and multi-task tests in an unprecedented complex environment, which set higher requirements for self-management. The current challenge lies in how to further build an integrated system of the virtual and physical space for spacecraft. In this tendency, the integration of Digital twin(DT) with spacecraft is also in its evolutionary trend. DT provides a data and model-based systematic approach for operation and management in the entire service life of on-orbit spacecraft. In this context, as a basic space system entity, the method of constructing DT of spacecraft is explored in this paper. Firstly, the concept of Spacecraft Digital twin (SDT) is put forward and four stages of simulation development are discussed from the perspective of DT. Moreover, the conceptual structure of four-dimensional model is proposed to adapt spatial distribution. After that, the key problems of SDT are discussed, including data acquisition, system configuration, and data service model. Accordingly, the future intelligent applications of spacecraft based on DT in autonomous cognition, autonomous operation and maintenance, as well as cluster collaboration are presented respectively.

452	DTCPS	An Evolution-Simulation-Verification Framework of Aviation Products in the Future	In order to accelerate domestic civil aviation technology development, raise the level of high-tech application, and keep up with the development trend of international civil aviation technology, an Evolution-Simulation-Verification framework was proposed in this paper. First, sort out the evolution model of the improvement area, clarify its roadmap, and then use digital twins or other numerical simulation methods to verify the concept and principle. When the corresponding product is developed, it will be deployed in the verification airport for testing. After the function and performance of the product meet the requirements, add it to the product library for selection. Through the above process, current problems could be handled, meanwhile, the evolution model can be continuously optimized and keep the roadmap advanced. The simulation and verification work can fully use the existing digital and physical resources to form an ecology to promote and guarantee the development of the aviation industry.

First, sort out the evolution model of the improvement area, clarify its roadmap, and then use digital twins or other numerical simulation methods to verify the concept and principle. When the corresponding product is developed, it will be deployed in the verification airport for testing. After the function and performance of the product meet the requirements, add it to the product library for selection. Through the above process, current problems could be handled, meanwhile, the evolution model can be continuously optimized and keep the roadmap advanced. The simulation and verification work can fully use the existing digital and physical resources to form an ecology to promote and guarantee the development of the aviation industry."",

The MVS is able to produce virtual world information in real-time which can be customized for the robots' workspace. In this environment, the robots can interact with the MVS via high speed serial communication link and behave as if they were swimming in the underwater-world even in the case they are deployed in a simple shaped testing-pool. This world which is virtually created using the sensory information of both the real and a virtual world is called ""synthetic world"". By testing in the synthetic world, the efficiency of underwater systems' development is improved because the software can be developed directly on the embedded computer system and the hardware/software cross-checking can be easily conducted.

454	DTCPS	Comparison of fault detection methods for a hydraulic accumulator loading circuit	This paper presents a comparison of some fault detection methods for a hydraulic accumulator loading circuit that can be used as automated condition monitoring tools in a cyber-physical system. Measuring the loading time and the accumulators pressure enables a categorization of different failure types derived from different combinations of a pump or an accumulator failure. The commonly used approach of observing only the loading time is compared to a manual feature engineering approach, a statistical feature extraction and selection approach and an image transformation approach. Tests on a digital twin of the hydraulic accumulator loading circuit show that all of the presented methods outperform the commonly used approach significantly. However, the statstical feature extraction and selection approach delivers the best accuracy.

455	DTCPS	Cognitive Digital Twin for Manufacturing Systems	A digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and autonomy of machines and products. Hence, the digital twin has been projected as the key enabler of the Visions of Industry 4.0. The digital twin concept has become increasingly sophisticated and capable over time, enabled by many technologies. In this paper, we propose the cognitive digital twin as the next stage of advancement of a digital twin that will help realize the vision of Industry 4.0. Cognition, which is inspired by advancements in cognitive science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, will enable a digital twin to achieve some critical elements of cognition, e.g., attention (selective focusing), perception (forming useful representations of data), memory (encoding and retrieval of information and knowledge), etc. Our main thesis is that cognitive digital twins will allow enterprises to creatively, effectively, and efficiently exploit implicit knowledge drawn from the experience of existing manufacturing systems and enable the transfer of higher performance decisions and control and improve the performance across the enterprise (at scale). Finally, we present open questions and challenges to realize these capabilities in a digital twin.
